## Bot the Builder

A Chrome Extension that asseses the ease of assembling a product. Bot the Builder uses NLP methods (Bag of Words, Sentiment Analysis, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to "read" customer reviews and rate the difficulty of assembling a product. It also goes one step further to explain why an item is hard to assemble by returning the top postiive and critical assembly reviews to the user as well as providing sub-ratings in: quality of the product, time to assemble, and parts/tools.
