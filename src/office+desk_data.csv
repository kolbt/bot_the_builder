"L-Shape Desk For The Win!","This desk is amazing and the company that I received it from is as well. I have been looking for an L-Shaped desk for a long time now as I definitely need the space. I ordered this one and it was delivered fast and even on a Sunday! The instructions for putting it together are super easy and the assembly is super simple as well. I was able to get it together and up in less than 20 minutes! I have even tested the sturdiness of this desk as I can be quite the grumpy gamer when I lose matches and it can handle my angry hulk smashes time and time again!

"Office Desk","Great work desk. It’s sturdy, very easy to put together & a nice material (doesn’t feel cheap), it’s also a nice size. I put it together by myself, would have taken less then an hour except I built it in my living room not realizing I would have to fit it through my hall way & through a door way...needless to say I can take this desk apart & build it again without the instructions.

"Reasonable L shape table, it is suitable for office not for gaming!","I really enjoy this table since it pretty lightweight compared to others, but its material looks very heavy duty and sturdy. I love the way they design the L shape. Instead of sharp, they make it shapes like a circle so that you have lots of room behind for wires and stuff like that. Overall, it is a good one for the office table, but if you are looking for a gaming table it shouldn't be an option for you in my opinion. It is not as wide enough as the regular gaming table. So if you are looking for an office table, this is the one for you!! I don't know why I cannot post a real picture of what I have set up but anyway, just give it a shot I would say :)","27 Mar 2020","","","Yes","hao do","5.0","L Shaped Desk Home Office Desk with Round Corner Computer Desk with Large Monitor Stand Desk Workstation,Black","/Shaped-Office-Computer-Monitor-Workstation/product-reviews/B081DWJ7KZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Very simple to put together and very sturdy.","I've been wanting to replace my old desk, which I have used for over 10 years now, with a more newer and spacious one.  This was perfect for the price.  Super simple to assemble, though one of the screws (on the number 1 bag) was the wrong size, though I was still able to put into place the needed part with other screws (3/4 used basically).  Anyways,  Its good for its price, very worth the money spent. Only thing I had a problem with was the monitor stand.  I use a TV for my PC so its large enough already, plus the stand was too high for me.  I put it upside down instead and used it as a make-shift storage for unused controllers, and other small electronics, so not much harm done. tl:dr  Very great table for the price.  Worth it.","15 Feb 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","John Michael P.

"Caveat Emptor","I want to let you know that this manual is mostly picture driven and that you may wind up changing up many things before you get it right. My biggest recommendation is to keep everything loose until you know that is is going to work. As for the integrity of the desk there is always going to be one part (pictured above) that does not center correctly no matter how many times you redo it (three for me) I could not get it flush. It does not seem like the kind of desk that will last for years to come.  If you bought this for gaming you probably do not want to use the monitor stand unless you got a cheap LCD like I did and have a little money to throw around. My final thought is that this desk seems more at home in a quiet setting which should help it last longer but you know the old saying caveat emptor (Let the buyer beware for those who don't speak Latin).","30 May 2020","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51b0TXmBg-L._SY88.jpg

"Gibberish instructions, but a good desk","I’m going to start off with the bad, I received the product defective. As shown in the pictures, there was supposed to be two holes on one side to insert the screws, but it was defective and one hole was on one side and the other on the correct side. I made do, and assembled it just fine after figuring out that the diagram was completely off and did not match ANY parts. I had to use the picture to assemble most of it. I did have trouble aligning the parts since the holes were mostly off or not a perfect fit. The good, It looks very nice assembled. It only wiggles (barely) on the side that is missing the screw. The height is perfect. It’s also long enough to fit my 32 in tv, Xbox and 22in monitor. I wouldn’t recommend using the shelf for the monitor as it would be way to high and a strain on your neck. Cleans good, and once you properly adjust the little caps on the legs, it’s perfectly straight and not wiggly. Had it not been defective and hard to assemble I would give it 4 stars because the quality is good. For a beginner gaming desk.","20 Jun 2020","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713gxIr2eXL._SY88.jpg

"Worth. Every. Penny.","I rated 4 stars due to the fact that I chose 1 day shipping and got it within 4 days. I understand if their was a message saying 'shipped within 2-3 days' but that wasn't the case. Overall, I love the desk. Sturdy, clean look and well built.

"Very sturdy, simple, and good looking multi propose desk","For size reference - picture is with a 27” monitor. Now I’m working from home more, I needed a desk for a larger monitor as wasn’t as productive with the a small laptop screen. This desk fits the bill perfectly and looks good too! It took me about 20 minutes to assemble by myself - all tools needed are provided and there are spares parts too. I did make one mistake putting the legs the wrong way round which only became an issue with the extra corner support bar, but we easy to remedy. Happy with the modern white color, simple design, size, and sturdiness. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing and highly recommend this for the price.","04 Jul 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713X1CaiVUL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Lee C","5.0","Foxemart Computer Desk 47” Modern Sturdy Office Desk PC Laptop Notebook Study Writing Table for Home Office Workstation, Black","/Foxemart-Computer-Notebook-Writing-Workstation/product-reviews/B07ZJPCNM2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Sturdy, nice looking and fits my remote work needs perfectly","Highy recommend. I was looking for a desk as I have been working remote since March and not going back until sometime in the new year (unless I am made full time remote).  I have been working on my dining room table with a laptop only. I recently had one of my monitors sent to me from my office as I do workshop production. this was too much for the dining room table on a regular basis.  My husband found this desk, I ordered it in Rustic Brown and it took two weeks because it shipped from California (I find delays in everything coming from there). It came last Thursday 7/30.  The color/finish is beautiful, it's sturdy, holds my laptop, one large monitor, a wireless keyboard, mouse, large mousepad, room for my paperwork.  It does not have drawers but I didn't need any. It took my husband 45 minutes to assemble.  Very happy as my work set up is comfortable and clean-looking.","04 Aug 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m0xWa1QiL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Foxemart 47 Inch Computer Table Sturdy Office Desk, Modern PC Laptop 47” Writing Study Gaming Desk for Home Office Workstation, White and Black","/Foxemart-Computer-Sturdy-Writing-Workstation/product-reviews/B089R6JWWW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Surprisingly good quality.","I was a little nervous about the quality of this desk especially because it’s on the cheaper side, but it’s everything I hoped it would be. The wood “finish” is beautiful. It’s lightweight, easy to put together, and fits how I wanted it to perfectly. I like that it’s more simplistic and industrial looking. It took maybe 10 mins top to put together. Instructions are lacking so don’t count on those but you really don’t need them anyway. It honestly looks better than the picture in my opinion. We did have issues with shipping (but that’s on UPS, not amazon even though amazon was quick to fix the problem, so we got it a week late).

"Absolutely perfect","I was impatient to get a new desk, as my kitchen table had been completely taken over with work supplies once the pandemic started. I ordered this to get my table back. It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but that's mostly due to me being unable to visualize measurements. It's the perfect size for a laptop or small desktop with a little extra space to the side for writing. I was also worried about leg room. I have long legs and often find my knees knocking into the underside of my desks/tables. As there are no drawers and the bars for the desk frame are only about an inch thick, this is definitely not an issue for me with this desk. I can stretch my legs out, cross my legs, or prop them up on a stool and not hit anything. Added bonus, my dog can curl up at my feet!","20 Jul 2020","Size: 39.4"" Color: Rustic Brown","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710ioOUdyYL._SY88.jpg

"Beautiful Desk Combo","I live in an apartment and have a home business so I needed a lot more office space put into an already cramped area. I originally had a student type corner desk in the same spot with two end tables on either side holding my pc, printer and stacks of paperwork.  After 2+ weeks of traveling to stores to physically see and measure the desks I could find I decided to go with the Bush Cabot L-shape desk along with the matching hutch from Amazon. I have owned it for a little over a month as of the writing of this review and have used it every day. I’m going to try and address the issues/questions I’ve read in other reviews. This is a mass-produced particle/press board furniture product, not solid wood and not hand crafted. If you have never owned or assembled this type of furniture take notes, the following goes for any furniture of this type. 1. Read the instructions from cover to cover before doing anything, then read them again and make sure all the parts/hardware are included. 2. It WILL scratch easily. The wood finish is more or less wall paper glued to the particle board. I even scratched mine due to impatience while hooking up my monitor (which is rather large and barely fit in the hutch opening-see pic). But since finishing the assembly I have had no scratches, I even use one of my mouses on the desk without a pad. I used a sharpie to cover it nicely. 3. Mass produced by machinery, not hand. This means that some of the holes may be slightly off, or not completely pre-drilled. It is a relatively soft wood product so lining up and “persuading” a screw to go where it is needed is easy. DO NOT use power tools to assemble, it is not necessary and any slips or over torquing WILL damage your furniture possibly to the point of no repair. 4. Buy a small bottle of wood glue to use everywhere a dowel is needed to add some stability. Most of this “assembly needed” furniture includes a small bottle in the packaging but this desk/hutch did not. You can find it at just about any store for less than $5 and it is worth it. 5. The wire management consists of a hook inside the pc cabinet and the USB port, not much else. There is a gap between the hutch backing and the desk that allows wires to be fed through, not very pretty but easy enough to manage with some wire ties, time and patience. (I plan on doing that one day…) 6. The phone charging tray/cubby is close to useless as most phones will only fit laying on their side and the “shelf” used to hold the charging tray is only 4.5” deep leaving it useless as anything else. (see pic) Also, the “tray” is felt covered and slides around, some two-sided tape or Velcro helps. It does work nicely on the desktop or on another table though. These things said, this is a beautiful desk/hutch combo for the price and it has plenty of storage and workspace. I have a printer, laptop, speakers, 27” monitor and pc tower all on the desktop with plenty of room to use each. (Yes, there is a space for the tower behind a beautiful glass inlaid door but I have a gaming pc that needs to be seen and not tucked away) My dog even has a bed underneath and I still fit fine. The construction is sturdy (especially after using the wood glue) and I am very happy with my decision to buy this combo. I ordered both the desk and hutch together and got a small discount from Amazon for doing so. Hope this helps.","16 Aug 2017","Color: Espresso Oak","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ot+MxkcRL._SY88.jpg

"Very nice corner unit for under 300! Def recommended 👍","Very nice desk for under 300 shipped although some reviews would lead you to think this isn't a nice unit at all. Totally false in my book and I am picky. The only blemish I found was on the fiberboard that is hidden on the back side tacked on. The drawers are off a bit on their alignment but I can deal for the price. I would recommend this unit, take your time, line up the bags of screws to see what all you are working with and since all pieces are stickered A-Z line them up and your putting together will be a breeze. It is quite a few parts that's my only suggestion.","09 Jan 2015","Color: Espresso Oak","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QrVe3iXVL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Jayme B.

"It's a great desk. This desk is sturdy and assembly was ...","I've had this desk and the matching lateral file for several month now. It's a great desk. This desk is sturdy and assembly was smooth compared to most furniture assembly experiences I've had. As far as customer service goes, the email contact page on the bush furniture website is awful and flat-out does not work. If you need customer service, CALL THEM. I ordered the matching lateral file and the anti-tip mechanism was defective. The person I spoke with was very helpful and pleasant to speak with. She mailed me a new one right away. I installed and haven't had a problem since. Pro TIP: Make use of the wire grommet next to the USB hub: You can use a Medium or ""16mm capacity"" metal binder clip as a very quick and easy cord manager for your various charging cables (I've attached pictures). The clip is 1 1/4"" wide and fits perfectly inside the grommet. No more charging cables falling under or behind the desk! This method keeps them readily available, but also keeps them from sticking above desktop.","13 Jun 2018","Color: Espresso Oak","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714xS7S5r7L._SY88.jpg

"Done with Amazon.","Absolute garbage! They forgot to box our bottom drawer So we only get one. None of the screws for the top drawer sit flush so you get an awesome clanking sound when they are opened and closed. I took them out, cleared out the holes and set them again. Still the same effect. The problem with cheap particle crap wood is that you can only do this once before the ""integrity"" of the particle board becomes compromised and the screws will be too loose. This is garbage. Literally and figuratively. I just spent the last four hours trying to put this together for my wife and I'll be damned if it's going to sit in her office like this. I'm giving Amazon 5 days to have this removed and a brand new one, already assembled, set in its place or I'm writing Amazon off for good. That means I'm returning my 2 Amazon echos and my 3 Amazon echo Dots. Also I will no longer be a subscriber to prime, Kindle or any of the many Amazon related subscriptions that I currently subscribe to.

"Easy to build, seems durable, looks nice. Obviously not a custom-built piece, but it isn't pretending to be, either.","Overall: We have no complaints about this desk. It is about on par or slightly better than IKEA's upper-middle line: particle board with the veneer over it, but it doesn't feel cheap and flaky, nor does it smell of glue.  Building this was an easy task for my husband and I, and I was 5 months pregnant at the time (no heavy lifting for me, but that didn't negatively affect the building process).  The only time we had some difficulty was getting the glass door hinges adjusted properly for the door to close without rubbing.  I think we over complicated that on our own, though, because we took the hinge apart before trying it at the default tightest setting, which ended up being the right one.  Also, when attaching the veneered backing, the nails have screw heads. I think this is because it offers a more finished look, but it was super confusing when we couldn't screw them in.  Of course, the instructions show using a hammer, but when you pick up a slightly threaded fastener with a screw head, it is natural to assume it is a screw, not a nail. Every single piece in this set is clearly labeled. All of the hardware and fixtures were labeled and present in proper number as well. Any of the labels are easily peeled off if some of them end up being visible.  The instructions are very clear and well-labeled.  The only time we had any confusion over the instructions was when we were building the drawers and had were supposed to have not reattached the runners to the drawer mechanism already in the cabinet (they were supposed to be attached to the drawers and then slid back on).  Not a big deal!  We realized our mistake and remedied it within two minutes. If you've ever built IKEA furniture, this is a walk in the park in comparison.  Any reasonable adult or adolescent should be able to build this piece with little difficulty, though it is definitely a two-person job at times. Tools needed: We used a cordless drill with the clutch helping us keep at a slow speed, but a screw driver would have worked fine. Regular claw hammer optional: rubber mallet for tacking in the included plastic floor protectors optional: wood glue to secure wooden pegs Building time: I am not exactly sure how long it took, but we accomplished it in an afternoon.  I think it was around 4 hours working at a leisurely pace. We unpacked both boxes, grouping like pieces together in our hallway for easy access, put the baggies of various sized screws/pegs/etc in numerical order, and then built on a beach towel to prevent scratching of our wood floors or new desk. Packaging note: This product comes in two (heavy) boxes.  The boxes are stapled and glued shut, and then are lined with Styrofoam inside.  Small boxes (often housing the bags of hardware) or pieces of styrofoam are used to keep the pieces from sliding around.  I was impressed with how well this was packaged!  However...at one point in shipping, one of our boxes had been dropped and was delivered in an obviously ""exploded"" fashion.  Fortunately, nothing was missing or damaged, and this is not an Amazon problem.  But, I think it is worth noting for both the positive and negative implications: these boxes can survive a beating, but be sure to count and check your pieces right away for damage if you get a damaged box. End result: My husband has his two 23"" monitors on one arm of the desk along with his two speakers, keyboard, and mouse; his computer is in the corner (he has a LAN computer with a case shaped like a milk crate...it isn't going to fit in any standard CPU cabinet, so we put the serge protector, wireless router, and modem in the cabinet); and a printer in line with the drawers on the other arm of the desk. It is a tighter fit than we had hoped, but, it is comfortable, and there is some room on the drawer-side arm for a laptop to sit, or some snacks, or just to have some basic elbow room. We haven't had any scratching or damage in the past couple of weeks of use.  Will update if anything bad happens.  :)","05 Jun 2016","Color: Harvest Cherry","","Yes","J.

"Works fine","Works fine for a decent desk, The finishing of wood is just a paper on MDF. Beware. IF you tend to stick something on it and peel it off, the paper will peel off too.. Also it retains moisture making it slightly bubbly later on. It is sturdy with all the L support it has. Takes a lot of time to put in if you plan to do it alone. Rather get someone to study the instructions and you may be able to speed up the process. I did it all alone and it took me 4 hours. I like to do it right the first time.I connected my dual monitors with a clamp stand and works fine. The USB outlet is 2.0. So if you plan to charge your phone, It will take ages. I so wished they had considered USB 3.0. Would have made our lives easy. Otherwise, the design is good. Looks stylish. I applied a water proof stain on it so it doesn't retain moisture.

"Don't be intimidated by other reviews","I'm a 22 year old gal who, on a good day, can tell the difference between a wrench and a ratchet. I am not handy. Having said that, this desk was NOT that difficult to put together. It took me about 3 hours (including gabbing with coworkers in between), I had no help, and I made no mistakes. Other reviewers make it sound like this is the rubik's cube version of a desk. It is NOT that bad!!!! The instruction manual wasn't great, but if you just let yourself take a moment to get used to it and follow the pictures, you'll be fine. It calls for a second person but again, I managed it just fine on my own. I enjoyed putting it together, and the results were gratifying! Does it look like a thousand-dollar desk? No. Does it look nice, though? Yes. very. It is extremely sturdy. Everything fit well together. The color is a very nice, rich, extremely dark brown. It is well represented in the photo. The desk is a little higher than what most are used to, but I love the height. Any regular office chair will do just fine. The key to putting this desk together: USE A POWER DRILL OR POWER SCREWDRIVER. I cannot imagine putting this thing together with a manual screwdriver. It would take forever. Use a drill and you will save yourself a ton of grief and a whole lot of time. Overall, for what it is, I love it. The price is more than reasonable and I am very pleased with the product. Do not be intimidated by other reviews. I even have the desk facing out where everyone who walks through my office door sees what other reviewers call the ""ugly"" backside. In my opinion, it looks just fine. No need to place against a wall or hide in a corner! Very pleased and would order again!","22 Jan 2014","Color: Espresso Oak","","Yes","Sierra","5.0","Bush Furniture Cabot L Shaped Computer Desk in Espresso Oak","/Bush-Furniture-Shaped-Computer-Espresso/product-reviews/B005EOL812/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Beautiful Desk Combo","I live in an apartment and have a home business so I needed a lot more office space put into an already cramped area. I originally had a student type corner desk in the same spot with two end tables on either side holding my pc, printer and stacks of paperwork.  After 2+ weeks of traveling to stores to physically see and measure the desks I could find I decided to go with the Bush Cabot L-shape desk along with the matching hutch from Amazon. I have owned it for a little over a month as of the writing of this review and have used it every day. I’m going to try and address the issues/questions I’ve read in other reviews. This is a mass-produced particle/press board furniture product, not solid wood and not hand crafted. If you have never owned or assembled this type of furniture take notes, the following goes for any furniture of this type. 1. Read the instructions from cover to cover before doing anything, then read them again and make sure all the parts/hardware are included. 2. It WILL scratch easily. The wood finish is more or less wall paper glued to the particle board. I even scratched mine due to impatience while hooking up my monitor (which is rather large and barely fit in the hutch opening-see pic). But since finishing the assembly I have had no scratches, I even use one of my mouses on the desk without a pad. I used a sharpie to cover it nicely. 3. Mass produced by machinery, not hand. This means that some of the holes may be slightly off, or not completely pre-drilled. It is a relatively soft wood product so lining up and “persuading” a screw to go where it is needed is easy. DO NOT use power tools to assemble, it is not necessary and any slips or over torquing WILL damage your furniture possibly to the point of no repair. 4. Buy a small bottle of wood glue to use everywhere a dowel is needed to add some stability. Most of this “assembly needed” furniture includes a small bottle in the packaging but this desk/hutch did not. You can find it at just about any store for less than $5 and it is worth it. 5. The wire management consists of a hook inside the pc cabinet and the USB port, not much else. There is a gap between the hutch backing and the desk that allows wires to be fed through, not very pretty but easy enough to manage with some wire ties, time and patience. (I plan on doing that one day…) 6. The phone charging tray/cubby is close to useless as most phones will only fit laying on their side and the “shelf” used to hold the charging tray is only 4.5” deep leaving it useless as anything else. (see pic) Also, the “tray” is felt covered and slides around, some two-sided tape or Velcro helps. It does work nicely on the desktop or on another table though. These things said, this is a beautiful desk/hutch combo for the price and it has plenty of storage and workspace. I have a printer, laptop, speakers, 27” monitor and pc tower all on the desktop with plenty of room to use each. (Yes, there is a space for the tower behind a beautiful glass inlaid door but I have a gaming pc that needs to be seen and not tucked away) My dog even has a bed underneath and I still fit fine. The construction is sturdy (especially after using the wood glue) and I am very happy with my decision to buy this combo. I ordered both the desk and hutch together and got a small discount from Amazon for doing so. Hope this helps.","16 Aug 2017","Color: Espresso Oak","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ot+MxkcRL._SY88.jpg

"Very nice corner unit for under 300! Def recommended 👍","Very nice desk for under 300 shipped although some reviews would lead you to think this isn't a nice unit at all. Totally false in my book and I am picky. The only blemish I found was on the fiberboard that is hidden on the back side tacked on. The drawers are off a bit on their alignment but I can deal for the price. I would recommend this unit, take your time, line up the bags of screws to see what all you are working with and since all pieces are stickered A-Z line them up and your putting together will be a breeze. It is quite a few parts that's my only suggestion.","09 Jan 2015","Color: Espresso Oak","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QrVe3iXVL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Jayme B.

"It's a great desk. This desk is sturdy and assembly was ...","I've had this desk and the matching lateral file for several month now. It's a great desk. This desk is sturdy and assembly was smooth compared to most furniture assembly experiences I've had. As far as customer service goes, the email contact page on the bush furniture website is awful and flat-out does not work. If you need customer service, CALL THEM. I ordered the matching lateral file and the anti-tip mechanism was defective. The person I spoke with was very helpful and pleasant to speak with. She mailed me a new one right away. I installed and haven't had a problem since. Pro TIP: Make use of the wire grommet next to the USB hub: You can use a Medium or ""16mm capacity"" metal binder clip as a very quick and easy cord manager for your various charging cables (I've attached pictures). The clip is 1 1/4"" wide and fits perfectly inside the grommet. No more charging cables falling under or behind the desk! This method keeps them readily available, but also keeps them from sticking above desktop.","13 Jun 2018","Color: Espresso Oak","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714xS7S5r7L._SY88.jpg

"Done with Amazon.","Absolute garbage! They forgot to box our bottom drawer So we only get one. None of the screws for the top drawer sit flush so you get an awesome clanking sound when they are opened and closed. I took them out, cleared out the holes and set them again. Still the same effect. The problem with cheap particle crap wood is that you can only do this once before the ""integrity"" of the particle board becomes compromised and the screws will be too loose. This is garbage. Literally and figuratively. I just spent the last four hours trying to put this together for my wife and I'll be damned if it's going to sit in her office like this. I'm giving Amazon 5 days to have this removed and a brand new one, already assembled, set in its place or I'm writing Amazon off for good. That means I'm returning my 2 Amazon echos and my 3 Amazon echo Dots. Also I will no longer be a subscriber to prime, Kindle or any of the many Amazon related subscriptions that I currently subscribe to. I've spent so many thousands of dollars over the past several years with Amazon and I'm sick and tired of them allowing crap like this to be shipped to their customers. I've had it. Figure this out Amazon or I'm done.","01 Jan 2019","Color: Heather Gray","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OHy1BnWML._SY88.jpg","Yes","Adam Harris","1.0","Bush Furniture Cabot L Shaped Computer Desk in Espresso Oak","/Bush-Furniture-Shaped-Computer-Espresso/product-reviews/B005EOL812/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Easy to build, seems durable, looks nice. Obviously not a custom-built piece, but it isn't pretending to be, either.","Overall: We have no complaints about this desk. It is about on par or slightly better than IKEA's upper-middle line: particle board with the veneer over it, but it doesn't feel cheap and flaky, nor does it smell of glue.  Building this was an easy task for my husband and I, and I was 5 months pregnant at the time (no heavy lifting for me, but that didn't negatively affect the building process).  The only time we had some difficulty was getting the glass door hinges adjusted properly for the door to close without rubbing.  I think we over complicated that on our own, though, because we took the hinge apart before trying it at the default tightest setting, which ended up being the right one.  Also, when attaching the veneered backing, the nails have screw heads. I think this is because it offers a more finished look, but it was super confusing when we couldn't screw them in.  Of course, the instructions show using a hammer, but when you pick up a slightly threaded fastener with a screw head, it is natural to assume it is a screw, not a nail. Every single piece in this set is clearly labeled. All of the hardware and fixtures were labeled and present in proper number as well. Any of the labels are easily peeled off if some of them end up being visible.  The instructions are very clear and well-labeled.  The only time we had any confusion over the instructions was when we were building the drawers and had were supposed to have not reattached the runners to the drawer mechanism already in the cabinet (they were supposed to be attached to the drawers and then slid back on).  Not a big deal!  We realized our mistake and remedied it within two minutes. If you've ever built IKEA furniture, this is a walk in the park in comparison.  Any reasonable adult or adolescent should be able to build this piece with little difficulty, though it is definitely a two-person job at times. Tools needed: We used a cordless drill with the clutch helping us keep at a slow speed, but a screw driver would have worked fine. Regular claw hammer optional: rubber mallet for tacking in the included plastic floor protectors optional: wood glue to secure wooden pegs Building time: I am not exactly sure how long it took, but we accomplished it in an afternoon.  I think it was around 4 hours working at a leisurely pace. We unpacked both boxes, grouping like pieces together in our hallway for easy access, put the baggies of various sized screws/pegs/etc in numerical order, and then built on a beach towel to prevent scratching of our wood floors or new desk. Packaging note: This product comes in two (heavy) boxes.  The boxes are stapled and glued shut, and then are lined with Styrofoam inside.  Small boxes (often housing the bags of hardware) or pieces of styrofoam are used to keep the pieces from sliding around.  I was impressed with how well this was packaged!  However...at one point in shipping, one of our boxes had been dropped and was delivered in an obviously ""exploded"" fashion.  Fortunately, nothing was missing or damaged, and this is not an Amazon problem.  But, I think it is worth noting for both the positive and negative implications: these boxes can survive a beating, but be sure to count and check your pieces right away for damage if you get a damaged box. End result: My husband has his two 23"" monitors on one arm of the desk along with his two speakers, keyboard, and mouse; his computer is in the corner (he has a LAN computer with a case shaped like a milk crate...it isn't going to fit in any standard CPU cabinet, so we put the serge protector, wireless router, and modem in the cabinet); and a printer in line with the drawers on the other arm of the desk. It is a tighter fit than we had hoped, but, it is comfortable, and there is some room on the drawer-side arm for a laptop to sit, or some snacks, or just to have some basic elbow room. We haven't had any scratching or damage in the past couple of weeks of use.  Will update if anything bad happens.  :)","05 Jun 2016","Color: Harvest Cherry","","Yes","J.

"Make sure all parts are included.","I read the reviews earnestly.  Should have heeded their warning.  I did not receive a set of screws, as well as a drawer mechanism.  I will have to wait 2 months for these parts.  I am very glad I checked this out, as per a suggestion from the reviews.  I don't have the original box, but, I'm so discouraged, now.  Meanwhile, I have put together a chair, a table and a bed.  They were all easy.  I love the color of this desk, It's gorgeous.  But I want something easier.  And more immediate.  And seeing it, in person, it's really massive.  As an apt dweller, eager to start my ""Adult life"", I want something a bit more compact and sooner.  I'll see what customer service says, and go from there...  I will say, though, their response time was very good.  Just not the parts. As an update, make sure you keep the box for returns.

"Works fine","Works fine for a decent desk, The finishing of wood is just a paper on MDF. Beware. IF you tend to stick something on it and peel it off, the paper will peel off too.. Also it retains moisture making it slightly bubbly later on. It is sturdy with all the L support it has. Takes a lot of time to put in if you plan to do it alone. Rather get someone to study the instructions and you may be able to speed up the process. I did it all alone and it took me 4 hours. I like to do it right the first time.I connected my dual monitors with a clamp stand and works fine. The USB outlet is 2.0. So if you plan to charge your phone, It will take ages. I so wished they had considered USB 3.0. Would have made our lives easy. Otherwise, the design is good. Looks stylish. I applied a water proof stain on it so it doesn't retain moisture.

"Don't be intimidated by other reviews","I'm a 22 year old gal who, on a good day, can tell the difference between a wrench and a ratchet. I am not handy. Having said that, this desk was NOT that difficult to put together. It took me about 3 hours (including gabbing with coworkers in between), I had no help, and I made no mistakes. Other reviewers make it sound like this is the rubik's cube version of a desk. It is NOT that bad!!!! The instruction manual wasn't great, but if you just let yourself take a moment to get used to it and follow the pictures, you'll be fine. It calls for a second person but again, I managed it just fine on my own. I enjoyed putting it together, and the results were gratifying! Does it look like a thousand-dollar desk? No. Does it look nice, though? Yes. very. It is extremely sturdy. Everything fit well together. The color is a very nice, rich, extremely dark brown. It is well represented in the photo.

Each part and each type of screw are marked with Alphabet and number, respectively. Thus allowed me to assemble it very easily.  The installation guidances in brochure are very detailed and inclusive,  covering all the accessories need to be set up in every step. After fixing the whole frame together, I put three tabletops on it and used silver screws to fix them to the frame, which is stronger than I thought.  No shaking is observed.

"Look elsewhere and save yourself the headache","Product has so many problems I will probably miss something. A) the instructions need to be rewritten. I got deep into installation before I realized that certain pieces were just slightly unique (where the drawer goes, where the headphone hook goes, etc) and I was too far in to undo what I had put together. B) holes don't align and the desk does not sit together. I have gaps and unlevel surfaces and there is no chance that I could have gotten this to install where all screws that secure the frame to the desktop align. You'll have 6-7 leftover screws, not including the extra pieces. Up to you whether you want to trust it. C) Box is low quality and the materials are poorly packed. You'll scramble through all the loose pieces hoping you have everything and that the box wasn't so damaged that you lost something. D) thew ""drawer"" is a joke. It says don't put more than 3.3 lbs in it. I wouldn't put more than .3 lbs in it.

"Great desk","I don't normally leave reviews, but seeing some deeply unfair ones, I felt compelled to share my experience. For the price, this desk is really as good as you can hope for. Instructions were included in the box, easy to understand, and the desk came together easily and feels nice and sturdy.

"Great purchase.","First off, I am a 58-year-old lady.  So when this heavy package arrived, I thought I was doomed.  But, after I managed to drag it into the house alone, it wasn't so bad.  I open the box downstairs, then I proceeded to bring the individual pieces upstairs to my office. The heaviest piece was the top.  Mind you, I do work out, so maybe that saved me. I hate putting stuff together. I usually stink at it.  Not to mention the fact that the instructions recommend 2 people assemble it. Well, there is only one of me, so off to work I went.  I actually managed to assemble this on my own with creative ways to ""hold"" up the pieces (kind of like a quasi person was present, even though they weren't).  I was pleasantly surprised how few times I actually cursed.  I have to say, the instructions (after getting out my magnifying glass), were good enough for even me to put it together. It was beautifully packaged, arrived with no dings or dents, and the parts and screws were identified with a number or letter.  You even got 1 extra screw for each type of screw that is used. Amazing. It was paradise for an assembly rookie like me.  I love the final product.  It's a good deal for the price.","15 Jun 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","","Yes","East Coast Lady","5.0","TOPSKY 55"" Computer Desk with Bookshelf/Metal Desk Grommet Hole Cable Cover (Industrial/Rustic Brown)","/TOPSKY-Computer-Bookshelf-Grommet-Industrial/product-reviews/B07RGLW1CW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"It is very sturdy","This product is heavy, I'd suggest you use a dolly to carry it. Don't ruin your back. The desk is easy to assemble. I suggest you use a powered screw driver or a driver with a bigger handle as the one they supply is very small. Do not step on the desk top, you'll crush and/or put a dent in it. I had zero damage on mine even though the box was banged up. I am 6'9"" and my legs fit underneath the desk with about a half inch of space between myself and the desk. If I had the space or the need I would buy this again. For the period of Covid-19. Your desk may take longer to ship. Do not worry, it will come.

It was very easy to assemble (approx 45 min) even when you don’t know what you’re doing, like me. The holes lined up perfectly and pieces were easy to figure it out. The height of the desk was perfect, not sure what some of the other reviewers were talking about and I’m 5’5”. My 6’1” gamer boyfriend loved it so much, we purchased a 2nd one for him. I have 3 22” monitors, docking station and laptop with plenty of room to spare. Cord management is good. The shelf underneath is good for extra storage and for hiding cords.

"If you need sturdy then it's here you've found it.","I was exhausted by the time I chose a desk, I had been doing so much research because I wanted something sturdy that could handle abuse and I wouldn't need to replace for years. With that in mind I was adamant to have something with wood AND metal, enter this beauty. I can't recommend this desk enough and if you're a fence sitter stop wasting time you've found the desk you need! This desk is very very sturdy, the color is attractive and it can even fit my behemoth Canon Pixma Pro 9000 and still leave me with working space. My home is small so I need things that can multitask so I thoroughly enjoy the shelf underneath as additional storage for all of my supplies. Assembly was a breeze for my husband and the screws came in separately marked bags along with a screwdriver! Guys they give you a screwdriver so you literally don't require any additional tools for assembly. Less than 30 minutes for it to be fully assembled and did I say it was sturdy? Because it's very sturdy 💯","21 Aug 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uXvnrhGuL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Anya","5.0","TOPSKY 55"" Computer Desk with Bookshelf/Metal Desk Grommet Hole Cable Cover (Industrial/Rustic Brown)","/TOPSKY-Computer-Bookshelf-Grommet-Industrial/product-reviews/B07RGLW1CW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Perfect desk, packaging gave me concerns though.","First the good: it's incredibly sturdy and stable. Doesn't flinch at any pushing or weight put on it. It's wide and spacious. There were fewer pieces than I thought there was going to be, so assembling was very easy and is doable by a single person, assuming you have the coordination for it. The color was nice, I picked the industrial rustic style. Cable management is pretty nice, although the cover for the hole has a sort of brush to cover the gaps between the cables; but this brush has already been permanently morphed by those cables after just a few days. It doesn't really matter, but it makes me question the purpose of the brush cover. The problem I have with this desk was the packaging. A lot of styrofoam for one. But worse than that, there was a lot of tiny hair-like clear fibers all over the pieces. I couldn't figure out what it was, but I can only assume it's fiberglass dust, which is a pretty big concern if it is. However, I'm not sure. I wiped down the desk multiple times with wet paper towels to collect the particles, but the fact that it was covered in that stuff is a concern. There still might be those particles in the hollow metal pieces, so I don't plan on taking this desk apart to risk spreading that stuff around.","16 Aug 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","","Yes","Sergio O.","4.0","TOPSKY 55"" Computer Desk with Bookshelf/Metal Desk Grommet Hole Cable Cover (Industrial/Rustic Brown)","/TOPSKY-Computer-Bookshelf-Grommet-Industrial/product-reviews/B07RGLW1CW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"I’m tall and this desk works for me","For 160 bucks it’s a great desk. I wasn’t expecting the desk that was going to fit all my needs in one at this price point. I have a extra bedroom in my house approximately 12x15 which I use has a office and seed germination room. I work in the gardening & landscape design field and is my favorite hobby. I’m also 6 foot 5 and 220 pounds, so most desks feel like they’re built for teenagers to me. The tops of my legs fit under this desk and I use it for my computer station alone. Only half the space is used but the other half I use for my arms and any documents I might have. I also have a drafting table in the room, and a germination station for my veggies before taking them to my greenhouse. After that long description of my use here’s what I like and don’t. Like: sturdy for the price, easy to put together, large work area. Dislike: shallow front to back width ( in all fairness anything less than 3 feet I’ll complain about ) If I walked into a store or someone’s home and saw this desk. I would buy it, and having bought it; I would buy it again.","17 Feb 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","","Yes","Dr. Stuvy","4.0","TOPSKY 55"" Computer Desk with Bookshelf/Metal Desk Grommet Hole Cable Cover (Industrial/Rustic Brown)","/TOPSKY-Computer-Bookshelf-Grommet-Industrial/product-reviews/B07RGLW1CW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great Desk!","I purchased this desk for a few reasons. I thought the price was reasonable based on shopping around. I love the color of the wood grain as it matches the room I have it in.  It was easy to put together for one person. All the parts lined up easily and there was even a screwdriver included to aid in assembly. I really like the shelf under the desk as that helped clear my work space.  I think it should have some support in the middle though. I was disappointed in the delivery (UPS).  I live in an apartment complex on the  top floor (third or two flights of stairs) and UPS left the box at the bottom of the stairs. I don't live down there!  The box was damaged but no contents were missing or damaged. The box can be carried but a awkward  shape and weight could make carrying challenging for some. All-in-all, I love the desk so far (Day#1).","17 Jul 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","","Yes","Eric M.

"Great desk, Good support","Quality: The wood is smooth, no scratches, and good quality with no dents on the edges or top/bottom of the piece. The metal legs however have a couple scratches and one of them has a minor defect where it's blistering or bubbling from the coating. In the long metal piece there was some sort of rusted metal nail or tack top that was rattling, but I was able to remove it from the small holes. This was probably just a production issue and I was unlucky enough to get it, but I was compensated for the issues. Durability: It's able to hold a good amount of items, I was able to put 2 monitors and my computer on top of my desk with no problems. On the shelf underneath it can hold a good amount of things without the wooden piece bending or moving. Very study desk even for heavy handed typers. Great for the price and hope it lasts long; would recommend. Will update later.","05 Aug 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-Q+oF6N+L._SY88.jpg

"Caving in!!","The packaging the desk came in was nice and sturdy. Main concern at first was the missing instructions, it took a lot longer than it should've to put together (45 mins). Once assembled I put a stand up desk which weighs about 75 lbs on this desk, and after a week the desk is starting to cave in. With the stand up desk and two monitors (maybe 100 lbs total), this desk has caved in a good amount. I've only had this desk for about a month and I need a new one already. Do not recommend.","17 Aug 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","","Yes","Zach M.","1.0","TOPSKY 55"" Computer Desk with Bookshelf/Metal Desk Grommet Hole Cable Cover (Industrial/Rustic Brown)","/TOPSKY-Computer-Bookshelf-Grommet-Industrial/product-reviews/B07RGLW1CW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"High quality for a reasonable price","I recently found out that my job will now be a work-from-home job indefinitely, and as such, I decided to invest in a proper workspace, instead of just slumping over my laptop on the couch (which is what I've been doing since COVID hit). I researched all kinds of desks with all kinds of features (shelves, automatic up/down, etc.), but decided I just wanted to keep things simple and get a pretty plain desk. This desk fit the bill and has solid reviews, so I took a risk and ordered. SUPER glad I did. This thing is great quality for the price. I was expecting flimsy particle board to be honest, but it feel very strong, like a thick plywood. And, the metal legs make it super secure and not at all wobbly. It was a snap to put together (took about 15 minutes), and I'm extremely happy with the way it looks---little shelf on the bottom is a great touch. I've also ordered a standing desk to place on top of this desk, and I have no concerns about the weight of it whatsoever. If you're looking for a sturdy, nice-looking work from home desk, I highly recommend this one.","26 Jun 2020","Color: Industrial/Rustic Brown","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Xd39SIZKL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","TOPSKY 55"" Computer Desk with Bookshelf/Metal Desk Grommet Hole Cable Cover (Industrial/Rustic Brown)","/TOPSKY-Computer-Bookshelf-Grommet-Industrial/product-reviews/B07RGLW1CW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Multi-functional desk","I was looking for a small but functional desk for a smaller apartment that I could easily bring in without hauling a heavy box and having to take out tools to put together. This desk caught my eye.  It is reasonably priced and could double as a side table when not used as a desk. It arrived 2 days ago and unpacked it tonight. I had some concern from reading other reviews because of damage but mine was fine. I took pictures of the process as I know I find these handy when deciding on a purchase. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'm going to put it in a 1 bed apt. It will be used for a side table for a lamp and fan and when needed take a counter stool from the breakfast bar as a desk chair for privacy. There is no tools needed to install it at all. It was nicely packed and had no issues putting it together in minutes. I could easily put it in a closet if we didn't want it out. I could also put it in the living room as a side table as well. Nothing real fancy, but looks nice, functional, sturdy and easily transported. I would purchase it again.","02 May 2018","Color: Brown","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HqVLI1ASL._SY88.jpg

"Terrible quality","Firstly, I was not able to setup the desk out-of-box. One of the joints of the frame was not properly tightened and would not fit the table top. I had to loosen up the joint and re-tighten it. While checking all the other joints for potential issue, I found one screw used for another joint already stripped. Then the table top fits poorly. The plastic hooks that holds the table top in place are badly stretched when I finally installed the table top. Moreover, one side of the table top is protruding above the metal frame, while the other side sunken below the metal frame. I hammered down the side which is higher than what it should be, but was unable to fix the other side that's sunken. The whole table is just crooked here and there.

"It was a good desk at first......but turned out to be awful, their customer service as well","This desk is easy to set up, and it looked firm and nice at first. However, after a few days, the wood became bent in the middle, where there were only a laptop and a monitor. I did not ask to return or replace the item because the box it came with has already been disposed of and if this is how the desk was designed then a replacement won't make much difference. Apart from being worried about that the desk may break, I also wonder whether the desktop was made from recycled materials and may contain harmful substances given its unfirm properties.
