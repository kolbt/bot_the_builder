"Good inexpensive chair that is comfortable for all-day use.","I was looking at chairs and was almost ready to dive in head first on an x-chair for $1100 - but then looked a little further and found this for around $70.  I ordered and it came in two days. The chair is decent quality and it is comfortable with the mesh back conforming to your back. Is it the most comfortable chair ever? No, but it works. The rollers are good (hardwood floor) and the assembly was easy, although I attached the arms to the back first and then attached the seat, finding that easier than the instructions.  I have had to tighten the main mounting bolts once now after a little over a week of use, but no big deal. The adjustments are decent - I mainly just raise it up and down, but it does have a spring-assisted ""recline"" that is nice when you just want to lean back for a bit. The arms are fixed and not adjustable - but I am rarely working with my computer with my arms to my side. I am large framed but not excessively overweight, and I have plenty of room in the chair (6'2"" 225lbs).  Good travel on the height adjustment to get you just right at your keyboard. Very happy so far with the chair. I was not paid or offered any bonus for my review.","03 Jul 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71C54Ea-08L._SY88.jpg

"Surprisingly easy for a 68-year-old retiree to assemble by himself","TL:DR? Video Slides (PDF file) showing each step of the assembly Video: Nine minute video (MP4) where I talk about the assembly I got this chair a few days ago. It was the first time that I've ever assembled my own chair. In the past, I've ordered them fully assembled or bought them locally, already assembled. I'm 68, retired, not strong, and not that handy with tools. When I need something hung on the wall, I usually ask someone else to do it for me. This chair is 100% better than the office chair that it is replacing. My prior chair allowed my thighs to bump into the arm rests. I do not have that problem with this chair. I also found my last chair, a leatherette chair, to not be comfortable for me to lean back against. This chair I regularly use the backrest and sometimes rock the chair. The lumbar support is perfect for my back. The curve of the mesh back matches the curve of my back. I'm 6'5"" tall, if that makes any difference to someone reading this. Because I wanted to review the chair, I decided to do it all of the work by myself. I deliberately did NOT ask my friend to come over and film me doing it because he probably would have interrupted me each time he thought he could do it better. (I got it 100% right on my own). Including unpacking the box, spreading everything around me, counting everything, doing the assembly, and taking pictures while I worked, it took me less than an hour. I'm sure that some young people could have done it in a quarter hour or less, but I referred to the instructions at every step. I only found one step of the instructions confusing, but once I figured it out, it made total sense. Steps 3 and 4 include the notation, ""50%"", which I finally realized meant ""finger tighten"" or ""loose tighten"". As I state in the video, you loosely attach the side pieces to the seat bottom, then to the seat back, then you tighten the screws in the base, then tighten them on the back. I'm not a handy person, but I found myself handy enough, assembling this chair. The instructions were clear, and are language-independent. You do not need to read English or Spanish to understand the instructions. Here are some tips: 1. Unpack and COUNT everything 2. The screws and allen wrench come in a nice plastic card with each compartment numbered. This makes it easy to count the screws in advance. I turned the card over and wrote the screw numbers on the back, then cut openings from the back so that I could remove the correct screws at each step of the process. 3. The wheels were not hard to attach, but you do have to push harder than some people might expect. Even though I'm not strong, I had no problem getting the wheels into their positions. I suspect it will be much harder to remove them if I ever need to replace a wheel. 4. Do be sure that you put the armrests onto the seat bottom so that the front of the armrests (the end without screw holes) properly points to the front of the seat (labeled on the bottom). 5. The ""50%"" notation in steps 3 and 4 mean to just finger tighten the screws at those steps. You want to be able to adjust the screw in the oblong holes before tightening the screws in steps 5 and 6. Though I don't show myself assembling the chair (I live alone), I have shown the steps that I went through with photos at each step. You can see the video, or you look at the images separately, which I have attached to this video. In addition, if you want all my images in one place, you can find them at the attached link. I am enjoying this chair. Like I said, I put it together by myself, and I'm not a hands-on man. I'm a computer programmer, not a handyman. I think most people with adequate eyesight and at least seven fingers can do a good job assembling this chair. Do NOT pay Amazon for expert assembly.","20 Oct 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711l3SUUMoL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Chair for a Teacher","I love my new chair! I am a teacher, so I do not get to sit very often. But, when I do, I want to be comfortable. Before I bought this chair, I used a hard, plastic student chair and my back often ached. I am super excited to add this chair to my classroom. Assembly The assembly took about 15 minutes. It probably would have taken less time if I paid attention to the clearly labeled LEFT and RIGHT on the armrest. All of the parts are labeled, and so were the screws. They even included extra screws. The instructions were also super clear. Comfort This chair is super comfy. The padding in the bottom is super thick, and the back net feels great on my back. The chair is very wide too. Look The chair is very sleek and modern. It doesen't look like an office chair that you you would find in a old stuffy office.

"Easy to Assemble. Comfortable.","If you are in the market for a new chair look no further. This chair was extremely easy to assemble, was able to do it in 20 min distracted by my favorite TV show. For a home office this chair is comfortable, leans back just enough however still feels sturdy and secure.

"Pretty nice chair for the money","Decent chair especially for the money; Pros: + Soft leather + Great lumbar support + Incredible price for a leather chair with this style Cons: - Chair back only reaches mid-neck for me and I don't have a long torso (I'm 5'11 but torso length is most important for seating height) - Where you sit (the mesh area) is the least padded area of the entire chair, and you can tell if seated for a while - Very minor, but wish they included washers for all the bolts on the bottom so you can torque them down nice and evenly Conclusion: I think you get what you pay for and then some with this chair. It doesnt have the side bolstering or padding that more expensive brands have but if you look at them, this Furmax chair actually has better lumbar support. However, this chair does NOT compete with those chairs IMO because it doesn't have the head support they do, but its a nice looking office chair. Furmax does make a gaming chair as well and the backrest on that one is over 4 inches higher to provide more head/neck support, I wish I got that one instead, but this one is still nice.","13 Mar 2018","Color: Black","","Yes","P.

"Good seat, poor assembly/parts & sketchy customer service","The chair itself is firm and comfortable, but after 6 months, the arm is loose on a daily basis. I keep the larger sized wrench that came with the seat in my computer desk and pull it out 1-2 times a day to tighten the arm. Additionally, the seat sinks a few inches from the highest position every few hours. It is rather annoying to keep having to fix the chair height and arm. So while the chair is comfortable, the constant adjustments are too much to earn a higher rating than 2/5 stars. Edit: After posting this review, the seller contacted me via text message saying they would refund me the full price of the chair if I changed my review to be based off their customer service instead of the chair itself. I agreed, thinking this was fair since the chair was not great (as mentioned above). However, the seller then only refunded me 50% of the cost and said I would have to DELETE my review to get the other half! Unbelievable. I contacted Amazon right away and they assured me I would get the full refund. I'm now changing my review to 1* after this horrible experience.","14 Mar 2018","Color: Black","","Yes","Alexander Phillips","1.0","Furmax Office Desk Leather Gaming, High Back Ergonomic Adjustable Racing Task Swivel Executive Computer Chair Headrest and Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Executive-Computer/product-reviews/B01LXXM5EK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"comfy but already peeling","The chair took some doing to assemble for one person but it's been sturdy enough and rolls easily on low pile carpet. It's comfortable enough to sit in all day and wide enough for me to tuck a leg under, which is nice. However, even though I've only owned the chair for two months, the material of the seat is already splitting and peeling. UPDATE: Not 3hrs after leaving the review, I was contacted by the seller, where they offered me a $30 refund to change this review to 5 stars. I feel that this is dishonest business and it casts doubt on the truth of other 5 star reviews on this product.

"Excellent chair","I had been using a cheap Target computer chair for a few months, since my old good-quality chair had finally given out after years of service and I didn't have the money to replace it with another good-quality model. I work at my computer for 8+ hours a day, so sitting in that chair without back support was causing me a lot of pain. I browsed around on Amazon for a few days, comparing different chairs. Overall, this one had the best reviews, so I took the plunge and ordered it. Two days later, this beauty was sitting on my front porch waiting to be assembled. Assembly: Super easy. There were MAYBE 5 steps to put it all together. All of the pieces were in the box and none of the pieces, including the actual chair part, were damaged or malformed in any way. Aesthetics: This is a nice-looking chair. The materials seem to be high-quality; no funky leather-ish smell at all either. It goes really well with my black computer monitor, black speakers, black desk, black computer, etc. Functional quality: This chair swivels and glides smoothly across the floor. The raise/lower lever doesn't stick, and the chair doesn't lower over time under my weight. I'm 5'8 and 260 lbs for reference, so it seems to be a pretty sturdy chair. It's not a tight fit when I sit down either; the seat itself is decently wide and deep. The back of the chair is sturdy yet forgiving- it's not like sitting against a brick wall, but it provides nice back support. The top of the back comes up to my ears (again, I'm 5'8 for reference). Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend this office chair to anyone who needs a comfortable, ergonomically supportive chair.","11 Jul 2017","Color: Black","","Yes","Noneya","5.0","Furmax Office Desk Leather Gaming, High Back Ergonomic Adjustable Racing Task Swivel Executive Computer Chair Headrest and Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Executive-Computer/product-reviews/B01LXXM5EK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"It may look like a great value, but don't waste your money.","***UPDATE*** Okay, so after just 4 months this chair completely fell apart. Sometimes, it's not just about the price tag. The price tag is often an indicator of a product made with weak materials and, in just four months, this chair proved to be a complete waste of money. ***ORIGINAL REVIEW*** Amazing value. I only bought this after going to office depot and seeing how expensive their selection was. I thought it would be a time saver to buy in person rather than having to wait for shipping, but my order came within 3 business days. It was extremely easy to set up and boy is this chair comfortable. It is wide enough for larger people like myself and has lots of cushion.

"Item was fine for the price","Item was fine for the price, decent quality material and pretty comfortable. But my reason for such a low review is due to problems with the product and bad support team from the seller. I had it for 3 months and already had problems with the gas lift, they sent another one and I replaced it and that one is also messing up. I asked for the whole thing to be replaced since its clearly a manufactured problem with the gas lifts I assume, but since I was over the days I couldnt get a replacement. Just a gas lift sent to me. I take very good care of all of my things so its not a problem on my end. Unfortunately there is nothing else I can do about this chair messing up. I would not recommend this chair to anyone, you're probably better off spending a bit more money to make sure you are getting a quality chair.","04 Aug 2018","Color: Black","","Yes","Mauro Duran","1.0","Furmax Office Desk Leather Gaming, High Back Ergonomic Adjustable Racing Task Swivel Executive Computer Chair Headrest and Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Executive-Computer/product-reviews/B01LXXM5EK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Best posture I've ever had!","I bought this to replace an old desk chair that I've had for years, and my back feels SO much better! This is the first computer chair I've had that feels actually comfortable, including all the chairs I've used at the office. I've never had good posture sitting at a computer, and I always catch myself slouching or leaning too far forward, but with this chair it's effortless. I'm surprised by how great this chair is for such a reasonable price! With that being said, because it's in a lower price tier, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles you might expect. You can't adjust the seat depth, the armrests, the back height, etc....really you only get to raise/lower the seat and switch between rocking (it doesn't rock very far) and non-rocking. It would be nice to be able to adjust the height of the back a little bit, but I'm okay with not having that option. The material is faux-leather and it has a bit of a chemical smell right out of the box, but it fades quickly. It looks great and appears to be put together pretty well--not perfect, but well enough that you won't notice if you aren't paying attention. Assembly was very simple, with easy-to-read instructions and no additional tools required. It would be a little easier to assemble with two people, but I managed just fine on my own.","08 Jul 2018","Color: Black","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Furmax Office Desk Leather Gaming, High Back Ergonomic Adjustable Racing Task Swivel Executive Computer Chair Headrest and Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Executive-Computer/product-reviews/B01LXXM5EK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Modern, Comfortable, Sturdy Chair!","This chair is very modern and really makes the old black desk chairs “a thing of the past.”  As you’ll see in the photos, the gray chair ties in nicely with gray painted walls. The five caster wheels are held in or place under a solidly-welded base support frame. The arms and chair back frame are a heavy grade plastic. I’m 250 lbs and feel like this chair could support someone much heavier than myself. The lever to raise and lower the chair works perfectly and locks into place when not using that function. I love the comfortable mesh chair back, and the seat cushion has a really nice dense foam padding that makes sitting in it for long periods very easy. I bought this chair to go with a desk I’m going to build, and will use the chair to measure the perfect height for my needs, but it does seem like it raises and lowers to average desk/table heights. The chair took 15 minutes to put together and the instructions were simple and clear. I’d recommend taking a couple minutes to uncover and lay out all the components and hardware to make assembly faster. The box this chair was shipped in was not much wider than the chair base, but the components were packed well and the chair is really a great average desk chair size.","10 Aug 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EXag5hZEL._SY88.jpg

"a stylish and affordable chair for my new makeshift home office","now that I'm working from home, I needed to upgrade my work setup. this chair was a good match for my white / grey decor and is much more comfortable than my dining chairs to do computer work. the back is well supported by mesh and the chair can rock back easily. the back is in a fixed position, so it is not adjustable for different heights, but the fit is still comfortable. I am a little nervous if food will get stuck in the cushion and mesh, so I'll probably have to vacuum it regularly to keep it fresh looking. the chair is easy to assemble, and there are clear instructions to part way screw the screws then completely screw them, so that it is evenly tightened.

"I absolutely love my chair","In the process of making my office and I had an old chair that was making my back hurt but this chair has a nice back shape to it that has helped a lot as well as the adjustment for height it can go up a good amount but since my desk is on the short side it’s also perfect","31 May 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714jQQE9GAL._SY88.jpg

"Good quality at an affordable price","Comfortable and affordable!  It was easy to install with clear instructions. We needed more office furniture since we work from home now. We stumbled across this chair and decided to buy it since it seemed comfortable and was really affordable. This chair did not disappoint. Lastly, it looks really nice and not like a typical office chair you get from Staples.

"Nicely packaged and easily assembled","Very well packaged to prevent damage. Once all items were unpackaged, it took an average of 20 minutes (using the provided manual wrench) to assemble each chair (two were ordered). Very easy steps with just pictorials, no wording. Note: the 50% reference means to NOT tighten the screws all the way to allow for adjustments. I purchased these chairs for my kids due to the new online schooling adventure. Very happy with the results at a reasonable price.","10 Aug 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711oERx0h4L._SY88.jpg

"An office chair with great support.","Pros 1. Easy setup. It took me maybe 5 minutes at most. Instructions are clear. 2. All functions work great. I like the amazing lower back support! Compared to some office chairs this was build for 100% support and helps correct your position. 3. Modern and simple design. Cons: 1. I am a petite girl and this fits me perfectly. However if you prefer a spacious chair the size is a bit small. Update : I had to change this to a 2 star due to the chair breaking! The adjusting function no longer locks so we cannot change the height. Update 2: customer service reached out and helped me figure it out. Very professional and helpful. My concerns were resolved. For that, this deserves 5 stars.","13 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Phoebe","5.0","Office Chair, Ergonomic Desk Chair Computer Task Chair Mesh with Armrests Mid-Back for Home Office Conference Study Room, Gray","/Ergonomic-Computer-Armrests-Mid-Back-Conference/product-reviews/B07ZV56SBZ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Solution to the weird front tilt issue","Ordered this chair after reading so many good reviews. The chair is durable, moves well, and is fairly comfortable. Unfortunately the chair does not recline so take that into account when purchasing this chair. The one big issue I had was that it kept tilting forward when I sat in it. On the bottom of the chair is a circular ""tilt tension"" mechanism (see the photo). Turn it tightly to the right to increase the tension and the chair will tilt less. I wish this was somewhere in the instruction manual but happy I found this solution. Hope this helps some of you. Update: Also found out when I put together the chair I put on the bottom attachment backwards. Make sure the tilt tension mechanism thing is facing the front of the seat. This helped fix the tilting problem I was having in addition to the tilt tension fix.","09 Sep 2018","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714I0wCfHoL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Harry S.","4.0","Furmax Office Mid Back Swivel Lumbar Support Desk, Computer Ergonomic Mesh Chair with Armrest (Black)","/Furmax-Support-Computer-Ergonomic-Armrest/product-reviews/B07B7K7N3P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"More Than What I Bargained For","Is this forreal? For under $40? Lol. I honestly didn't know what to expect. All I knew is that I did not want just any kind of chair. I currently have 3 office-style chairs in my house that each sit at a desk. There are also a lot of fantastic, high-end, expensive desk chairs at my job that I work from. The three chairs at my home are just ok, with only one giving an overall sense of satisfaction. The ones at my job are exclusive and really comfortable to sit in. None of them are leather by the way. I happen to not be a fan of leather chairs and couches. They tend to be bulky, rough, and not so pleasant to sit in for long periods of time. I didn't want that for my new desk space. I searched endlessly and tirelessly online for what I hoped to be a lasting chair that would provide ease, comfort, relaxation, durability, and bolstering. This chair by Furmax gets a 5/5 in every category. It took me just about 25 minutes to assemble (which is only because I'm not much of a handy tool guy). I'd say this chair takes 15 minutes tops to assemble when done precisely and correctly. The moment I sat in it, I was instantly relieved of any doubt or speculation that it wouldn't be of long-term use for me. The seat itself, which you can see in the pics, is large, plush, and incredibly comfortable to sit on! I'm pleased every time I sit in it. I wondered if the handles would be hard when I was purchasing it, but they are actually totally relaxing while being firm enough to hold and lean on. The chair's back is quality at its finest with ultimate back support. Seating adjustment with the lever is as simple and easy as it gets, and the height just right!  The wheels move smoothly and easily across my hardwood floor with absolutely no means of scratching or denting it. This chair is total finesse! I wholeheartedly recommend it to you. It is the best of all my home desk chairs, and can even compete with the best of the high end office chairs at my job. For the price it is superb! Your entire body will appreciate you getting it this chair. Lol!!! What an awesome Furmax product.

"This is a very good chair. For the money it is nearly unbelievable","I’ve had it for just a couple days but want to add my positive review to the others. This is a very good chair. For the money it is nearly unbelievable. I assembled it quickly, although the directions weren’t of much use. I found it quite comfortable, exceeding my expectations by a wide margin. Some reviewers complained that it is narrow across their thighs. I’m 5’10,165 lbs and it fits me perfectly, although I suppose I can see that this might be a problem for some. It is constructed out of materials of good quality. The plastic and cloth feel substantial. The hardware is of good quality. The engineering is superior. One reviewer claimed the arm rests came off when he stood up. Unless it was not assembled, this is impossible. It is a solid piece of furniture. But, it’s not a $500 office chair.

"Broke in 1 week - Cheaply made but ok for the price so far...let post is not well designed","Updated - within a week my son sat and the back broke and he fell backwards hurting his back.  Doctor says it is just a bad bruise and no broken bone thank goodness.  Tried to contact seller with amazon help to send pictures asking for an email .  Didn’t get and email .  Amazon asked again and they said for me to send the pics via Chatbox on PC .  I don’t know what that is and contacted amazon again.  Amazon certified I don’t have access to Chatbox so not sure why seller is delaying this .  Just give me the damn email address so I can send you the pictures of the damages .  Amazon is on the line now disputing this and filing a claim on my behalf.  So frustrating with this product and seller . Kind of cheaply made but for the price it’s not bad .  Seat cushion kind of thrown and doesn’t look like it will hold up for too long.  Don’t like the leg as it doesn’t screw on and the chair is left stacked on top of the one leg post without any screws so if you pick it up it will separate into two pieces therefore may cause personal harm if you fall of due to the instability.

"NEGATIVE 1 STAR AT BEST!!! I wish I purchased ANY OTHER chair!","The directions were difficult to understand because they were obviously translated poorly from the country where this was made. The pictures with the directions were confusing and unclear as well. I found the sticker that was supposed to be on the front of the seat, but the seat is NOT where I found it at all. Still, I figured it out and got it together. Once I did, I tried it out and found that the up/down mechanism did not work. I was pretty sure I didn't have it reversed, but found no other reason for it to not work. So I took it apart and reversed it, only to find that I had it right the first time. I switched it back and still the chair doesn't go up or down. SO the seat is stuck in a position which is too high for my legs to comfortably reach the floor. I bought this chair because I needed something that would be good for posture and back health, but now I am stuck with the opposite. AS IF THIS WAS NOT BAD ENOUGH... The black plastic from the arm rests has ruined a bunch of my shirts! It comes off when my elbows rub the arm rest or when I rest my arms. I noticed the plastic on my skin too from when I was wearing short sleeves. The black on my elbows came off with soap and water but the clothes are destroyed. . Since I have put duck tape around the arm rests so that I can make do with this ""PIECE OF JUNK"" until such time when I can buy something else. If you are someone who does not have money to throw away, BE WARNED!

"Broke in 1 week - Cheaply made but ok for the price so far...let post is not well designed","Updated - within a week my son sat and the back broke and he fell backwards hurting his back.  Doctor says it is just a bad bruise and no broken bone thank goodness.  Tried to contact seller with amazon help to send pictures asking for an email .  Didn’t get and email .  Amazon asked again and they said for me to send the pics via Chatbox on PC .  I don’t know what that is and contacted amazon again.  Amazon certified I don’t have access to Chatbox so not sure why seller is delaying this .  Just give me the damn email address so I can send you the pictures of the damages .  Amazon is on the line now disputing this and filing a claim on my behalf.  So frustrating with this product and seller . Kind of cheaply made but for the price it’s not bad .  Seat cushion kind of thrown and doesn’t look like it will hold up for too long.  Don’t like the leg as it doesn’t screw on and the chair is left stacked on top of the one leg post without any screws so if you pick it up it will separate into two pieces therefore may cause personal harm if you fall of due to the instability.  Don’t know how long this will  last. Whynter WC-211DZ","28 Apr 2019","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LhGiHZwTL._SY88.jpg

"Overall a good chair","Nice inexpensive chair. Fairly easy to assemble. They actually give you a long handle hex wrench makes installation a lot easier. The washers are slightly bigger  then the molded plastic holes they are to go in but it doesn't affect the structural Integrity of the chair . Assembled in less than 15 minutes.

"NEGATIVE 1 STAR AT BEST!!! I wish I purchased ANY OTHER chair!","The directions were difficult to understand because they were obviously translated poorly from the country where this was made. The pictures with the directions were confusing and unclear as well. I found the sticker that was supposed to be on the front of the seat, but the seat is NOT where I found it at all. Still, I figured it out and got it together. Once I did, I tried it out and found that the up/down mechanism did not work. I was pretty sure I didn't have it reversed, but found no other reason for it to not work. So I took it apart and reversed it, only to find that I had it right the first time. I switched it back and still the chair doesn't go up or down. SO the seat is stuck in a position which is too high for my legs to comfortably reach the floor. I bought this chair because I needed something that would be good for posture and back health, but now I am stuck with the opposite. AS IF THIS WAS NOT BAD ENOUGH... The black plastic from the arm rests has ruined a bunch of my shirts! It comes off when my elbows rub the arm rest or when I rest my arms. I noticed the plastic on my skin too from when I was wearing short sleeves. The black on my elbows came off with soap and water but the clothes are destroyed. . Since I have put duck tape around the arm rests so that I can make do with this ""PIECE OF JUNK"" until such time when I can buy something else. If you are someone who does not have money to throw away, BE WARNED! Obviously, there are some positive reviews, but why take a chance that you will be stuck the way that I am?","21 Apr 2019","Color: Black","","Yes","AmyCatD","1.0","Furmax Office Mid Back Swivel Lumbar Support Desk, Computer Ergonomic Mesh Chair with Armrest (Black)","/Furmax-Support-Computer-Ergonomic-Armrest/product-reviews/B07B7K7N3P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Nice chair for the money","I purchased this chair for working from home during the Covid era. Over the past five months, I've tried numerous chairs I already owned, and none were cutting it. I've used this chair for approximately 30 hours now and am, so far, happy with it. The chair was relatively easy to assemble except for two of the wheels, which were UNBELIEVABLY  difficult to snap into place (but the other wheels were fine). It took about 20 minutes to assemble the chair (after I fought with the wheels for two hours, that is!). The chair is comfortable,  with a nicely-padded seat, flip-up armrests, and a mesh back. It is easy to adjust the height, as well.","06 Sep 2020","","","Yes","Used to Write","4.0","KOLLIEE Mid Back Mesh Office Chair Ergonomic Swivel Black Desk Office Chair Flip Up Armrests with Lumbar Support Adjustable Height Computer Task Chairs","/KOLLIEE-Ergonomic-Armrests-Adjustable-Computer/product-reviews/B085Q9PXR1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Just buy it!","Buy this chair now! I'm doing to do my best to be as concise as possible and refrain from going on an endless rant about how much I love this chair.What I'm going to do instead is accurately and thoroughly review this marvel of modern engineering. First I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a 6 foot tall 250 pound military member with previous surgery on L5S1 which has left me with nerve pain every day of my life as well as problems on three other levels of my spine. Generally chairs aren't designed to seat a person of my stature and won't last very long. I require a chair that's very sturdy, adjustable and ergonomic. The box came, overjoyed I struggled to lift it into my apartment. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the box. It gave me a sense of assurance in knowing that I bought quality. The Hardware felt to be of good manufacturing. Also I received double the hardware necessary to assemble the chair. I LOVE EXTRA HARDWARE. The instructions were very well illustrated and the chair built in minutes. One thing that I really appreciated was the way adjustments were engineered into the design of the chair. While assembling you can adjust the width of the arm rests. Once the bolts are tightened down your arm rests will only adjust up and down. Another adjustment built into the chairs construction is controlling the distance from the seat to the back rest. This is generally only a feature on higher end chairs and I was happy to see that is has quite a bit of range. The roller blade wheels are amazing! My apartment has tile floor and my old terrible chair struggled to move anywhere, often getting tiny wheels stuck in the grooves of the tile. It generally made navigating chasms of my unorganized room clumsy and difficult. With these rollerblade wheels I can glide from one end of the room to the other. Its effortless, I love it. The mesh feels very comfortable and breathable. The lumbar support is amazing. I nearly fell asleep the moment I sat in this. The lever that allows the chair to tilt back or sit straight up is the kind of lever that you push down or pull up. This is very good because some other chairs have a lever that's essentially a bar that you slide horizontally. Over time the bar can work its way out so when you go to sit back in your chair the lever pops out and the char sends you flying backward. This has happened to me at least fifty or sixty times and I have ended up on the ground as a result of this. The design of the seat back lever of prevents this from happening. This chair is so comfortable that I felt the need to write this review as soon as I sat down. Already my back feels better, my nerve pain is reduced.  I had been sitting on a broken chair for over a year and a half until I noticed the amount of discomfort I was ignoring and pulled the trigger on this. I will update this review if anything changes or the chair fails over time.","18 Jul 2018","","","Yes","George","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"A Review For Shorties","I recently began working from home 4 days a week, and needed a good chair at a reasonable price.  Being only 5' tall, I'm always nervous about the fit of chairs.  For one, the headrest.  Almost all headrests are too high for me, and just basically push my head forward. I was pleasantly surprised to find that when lowered all the way, this one actually fits me perfectly! It also adjust to much higher for those of you who aren't as vertically challenged.  I love that not only does it adjust up and down, but also the angle of it adjusts, so it truly fits just right. That being said, if you're mostly using this to work, like I am, the headrest may not even matter that much, as I'm usually sitting up straight. Still it is nice when I want to lean back. Next is the lumbar support- lack of support can be a nightmare for lower back issues. It's great, and really extends quite a ways in, also good when you're short and can't always sit as deeply into a seat. On that note, that's one thing I wish was adjustable- the depth of the seat. You can't change that or move it in and out, but to be honest for that kind of customization, you're usually looking at a far more expensive chair, so again, the lumbar support helps a little with that. The other thing I wish could adjust just a TINY bit more is the height of the seat. At the lowest, while sitting all the way back, the balls of my feet rest comfortably on the floor, but not my full foot flat. To be fair, I'm working at home, so usually barefoot. If I had even a slight heel on, or even a thick athletic shoe, it would probably be fine. Just wish I could lower the seat by maybe one more inch. The wheels don't roll very easily on carpet unless they are at the right angle, kinda like a shopping cart has to have its wheels just right, but if I get a protective mat, which I probably should anyway, it would move much more easily. Glides across hard floors with no issue at all, and I haven't found it to be a big deal on carpet, honestly. It was easy to put together, and feels very sturdy. All in all, this is a great chair for ALL heights, even us shorties, and I'm very pleased for the price with what I got.","15 Mar 2019","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"ADJUST YOURSELF TO ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE OFFICE CHAIRS I HAVE EVER SAT IN!!!","When I decided I needed an office chair for my home office I went to Amazon and started looking. I looked at some 15-20 different office chair, drafting chairs and others. Read about 50 reviews to see what people liked and didn’t like. It was helpful in considering what I needed for a bad back. I finally chose this Duramont Ergonomic model. I could not be happier. The adjustable lumbar support was a clincher in deciding to buy it. The other features I liked was the ability to adjust so many features of the chair. The arm rests move up and down with the push of a button when the chair is set up. I also liked that they could be moved forward and backwards as well as closer together (narrow the width). While these adjustments requires some after assembly screw loosening adjustments they are very easy to make (don’t overtighten the screws when attaching the armrests to the seat). The other adjustments that can be made include the angle of the seat back, the tension it takes to move the seat back, the height of the seat, the height and fit of the head rest (I wasn’t looking for a headrest but glad that the chair has it) and most importantly for people with lower back problems, the placement of the lumbar support. You don’t realize how desirable it is to have all these adjustable features until you finally adjust them and sit in the chair. The chair was a cinch to put together, it took about 30 minutes. Parts were clearly marked, necessary tools were provided, two Allen wrenches. The fit and finish was excellent. It is a quality chair. But the most important consideration is how comfortable it is. One reviewer said he almost fell asleep when he was writing his review. I can see why, it is that comfortable. I wanted mesh for breathability and comfort and this chair has it. I don’t know how long these chairs are supposed to last but my read on quality putting it together indicates it should last a long time. Given all the features I think this chair is well worth the $240 I paid, especially when you look at well known brands like Herman Miller whose chairs sell for $1,000 or so. THIS IS A GREAT VALUE.","03 Dec 2018","","","Yes","Dbonds","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Easy assembly and comfortable","As a person with lower back pain due to improper posture, I could really use an ergonomic chair to help me achieve a better sitting position. This chair does just that. I like the adjustment options this chair offers. I love that the headrest can be lowered, raised, tilted or removed. There is a little hex bolt on the headrest that allows you to lock the tilt in place, but I like to keep it a little loose so that it can conform to my seating position. The parts that make up the chair seem to be of good quality. I like the seat. It is soft, yet firm. It is softer than the harder office chairs, but firm enough to support you. The breathable grid-like pattern is also welcomed. There's a little knob that adjusts how much the chair is pushed into your lower back which is just fantastic. No need for a lower back cushion with this chair. The wheels on this chair are rollerblade wheels which I immediately switched out for the caster type wheels as I read this advice from other reviewers. The reason is that the rollerblade wheels work really well on hard surfaces, but no so much on carpet; which I have. Assembly is pretty straightforward - stick in the wheels to the base. Add the hydraulic mount. Add the armrests to the seat and then add the back. Then stick that onto the mount. I recommend getting a box or someone to give you a hand to support the seat when adding the armrests or the back to the seat.","13 Nov 2018","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LqWJjCTsL._SY88.jpg

"It's the unicorn of office chairs, finally!","I'm so happy that I scored this quality chair over the Black Friday weekend.  I've been searching for over a year to replace my old fake leather old home office chair that I've had for almost 20 years.  This ergo chair is very comfortable because it's adjustable all over and has good lumbar support. Assembly was tedious because it comes in a lot of separate parts.  10 minutes to unpack it and cut off all of the protective foam, plastic bags, cardboard wraps, etc. but the chair did arrive fully undamaged so I appreciated the extra caution with the packaging.  The instructions are very clear except for one part about which  arm goes on which side of the seat .  You can't tell from the pic, even though the arms are labeled.  Of course I did it wrong and had to take it all apart and rebuild.  Duh.  Aside from that little glitch, it's easy to build once everything is spread out.  Adjustments are simple and as expected. I'm so impressed with how quiet and solid this chair is, at least for now.  I'm a big guy (6'1"" and 275 lbs) and this thing is so supportive and doesn't feel like it's going to buckle or anything.  I like the mesh back so it doesn't get hot.  The seat cushion is a bit firm honestly, but supportive.  Strong mechanism for tilt/rock and the casters are like those clear plastic old rollerblade wheels.  They roll decently even on bare carpet. A headrest was a must.  I sit at a computer for hours at a time for work, and leaning back with the ability to rest my head and neck is necessary.  This chair has an adjustable height/tilt headrest that is great.  I thought I was going to have to buy another leather chair again with a high back like those executive ones.  Nope. Arm rests are supportive and padded so they are easy on the elbows.  Good sturdy height adjustments too, so my hands line up perfect with the keyboard on my taller desk so my wrists don't ache. Overall, this chair is built very well and it's very supportive for us desk jockeys.  It doesn't squeak or rattle or feel like it's going to tip or break.  I'm so happy I finally found my office chair unicorn.","03 Dec 2019","","","Yes","Mudhole","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"This is a great buy","So about a month ago I had to start working from home and decided to set up a mini home office for myself. As for the chair, I wanted something comfortable but not too expensive so I bought the AmazonBasics chair and what a horrible experience it was.  When seated with good straight posture, the lower frame of the backrest is the first portion to make contact with my back. In order to use the backrest without the bar pressing into my back, I must use a pillow to help bridge the gap or sit slouched back. And cushions are not comfortable at all. This time, I figured I a bit pay more and treat myself and my back well. So I found Duramont ergonomic adjustable chair and let me tell you something: IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY. It is easy to assemble, really comfortable and great back support. I am super happy with my purchase and definitely suggest it to anyone looking for an extra comfortable chair with a reasonable price. You really want to spend a bit extra on a good chair so you do not end up with neck-ache or backache later on (which happened to me after using previous chair for only 1 week).","31 Mar 2020","","","Yes","NimaH","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Heavy duty craftsmanship, for a heavy duty customer, (lol)","After weeks of sitting in a office chair that was broken and almost on the ground entirely, I would’ve taken almost any seat that was in better condition. However, this office chair is far better than I would have expected. I’m a pretty heavy set guy and like heavy duty things. When the box arrived and I popped it open, I was surprised to find a very strong, heavy duty and durable chair, (in pieces, but half the fun is putting it together, lol). After assembling the chair, I sit down and test it, afraid that I might break it, (I’m that heavy). But, to my surprise yet again, I can feel the weight of the materials used in its construction, and for the first time I don’t feel like I’m gonna break my chair. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has the same fears as I. The price might be up there, but it’s worth it.","24 Apr 2020","","","Yes","Justin Menor","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Just buy it!","Buy this chair now! I'm doing to do my best to be as concise as possible and refrain from going on an endless rant about how much I love this chair.What I'm going to do instead is accurately and thoroughly review this marvel of modern engineering. First I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a 6 foot tall 250 pound military member with previous surgery on L5S1 which has left me with nerve pain every day of my life as well as problems on three other levels of my spine. Generally chairs aren't designed to seat a person of my stature and won't last very long. I require a chair that's very sturdy, adjustable and ergonomic. The box came, overjoyed I struggled to lift it into my apartment. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the box. It gave me a sense of assurance in knowing that I bought quality. The Hardware felt to be of good manufacturing. Also I received double the hardware necessary to assemble the chair. I LOVE EXTRA HARDWARE. The instructions were very well illustrated and the chair built in minutes. One thing that I really appreciated was the way adjustments were engineered into the design of the chair. While assembling you can adjust the width of the arm rests. Once the bolts are tightened down your arm rests will only adjust up and down. Another adjustment built into the chairs construction is controlling the distance from the seat to the back rest. This is generally only a feature on higher end chairs and I was happy to see that is has quite a bit of range. The roller blade wheels are amazing! My apartment has tile floor and my old terrible chair struggled to move anywhere, often getting tiny wheels stuck in the grooves of the tile. It generally made navigating chasms of my unorganized room clumsy and difficult. With these rollerblade wheels I can glide from one end of the room to the other. Its effortless, I love it. The mesh feels very comfortable and breathable. The lumbar support is amazing. I nearly fell asleep the moment I sat in this. The lever that allows the chair to tilt back or sit straight up is the kind of lever that you push down or pull up. This is very good because some other chairs have a lever that's essentially a bar that you slide horizontally. Over time the bar can work its way out so when you go to sit back in your chair the lever pops out and the char sends you flying backward. This has happened to me at least fifty or sixty times and I have ended up on the ground as a result of this. The design of the seat back lever of prevents this from happening. This chair is so comfortable that I felt the need to write this review as soon as I sat down. Already my back feels better, my nerve pain is reduced.  I had been sitting on a broken chair for over a year and a half until I noticed the amount of discomfort I was ignoring and pulled the trigger on this. I will update this review if anything changes or the chair fails over time.","18 Jul 2018","","","Yes","George","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"A Review For Shorties","I recently began working from home 4 days a week, and needed a good chair at a reasonable price.  Being only 5' tall, I'm always nervous about the fit of chairs.  For one, the headrest.  Almost all headrests are too high for me, and just basically push my head forward. I was pleasantly surprised to find that when lowered all the way, this one actually fits me perfectly! It also adjust to much higher for those of you who aren't as vertically challenged.  I love that not only does it adjust up and down, but also the angle of it adjusts, so it truly fits just right. That being said, if you're mostly using this to work, like I am, the headrest may not even matter that much, as I'm usually sitting up straight. Still it is nice when I want to lean back. Next is the lumbar support- lack of support can be a nightmare for lower back issues. It's great, and really extends quite a ways in, also good when you're short and can't always sit as deeply into a seat. On that note, that's one thing I wish was adjustable- the depth of the seat. You can't change that or move it in and out, but to be honest for that kind of customization, you're usually looking at a far more expensive chair, so again, the lumbar support helps a little with that. The other thing I wish could adjust just a TINY bit more is the height of the seat. At the lowest, while sitting all the way back, the balls of my feet rest comfortably on the floor, but not my full foot flat. To be fair, I'm working at home, so usually barefoot. If I had even a slight heel on, or even a thick athletic shoe, it would probably be fine. Just wish I could lower the seat by maybe one more inch. The wheels don't roll very easily on carpet unless they are at the right angle, kinda like a shopping cart has to have its wheels just right, but if I get a protective mat, which I probably should anyway, it would move much more easily. Glides across hard floors with no issue at all, and I haven't found it to be a big deal on carpet, honestly. It was easy to put together, and feels very sturdy. All in all, this is a great chair for ALL heights, even us shorties, and I'm very pleased for the price with what I got.","15 Mar 2019","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"THE CHAIR!","Why this chair even came w/a device taped to the outside of the box for helping cut the packing tape! & what's more, they even included a pair of WHITE GLOVES to wear while assembling the chair!  So...if they would do this sort of preparation just for receiving & assembling a chair, surely you can imagine the detail to quality that is obvious  w/the chair itself!  This is the chair of a lifetime!  You gotta get one to see what I mean.

"Great quality chair for the price!!!","Wow what can I say! I wanted a $800 Hermon Miller for the longest time but it was simply not in the budget. I work from home 4 days a week 10 hours a day. Old chair was no longer cutting it anymore. I am 6 ft tall and heavy. I was impressed with the quality of this chair. For the price it simply cant be beat. The casters and base are metal and the rest of this chair fit and finish is spot on. Its also very comfortable. The armrest width, height, Head reset, back rest support just perfect! Everything! Feels nice and solid. If you are considering a high end chair costing $300+. Save your money and try this baby out first! Along with everything else I mentioned it also comes with a 90 day in-home guarantee.

"ADJUST YOURSELF TO ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE OFFICE CHAIRS I HAVE EVER SAT IN!!!","When I decided I needed an office chair for my home office I went to Amazon and started looking. I looked at some 15-20 different office chair, drafting chairs and others. Read about 50 reviews to see what people liked and didn’t like. It was helpful in considering what I needed for a bad back. I finally chose this Duramont Ergonomic model. I could not be happier. The adjustable lumbar support was a clincher in deciding to buy it. The other features I liked was the ability to adjust so many features of the chair. The arm rests move up and down with the push of a button when the chair is set up. I also liked that they could be moved forward and backwards as well as closer together (narrow the width). While these adjustments requires some after assembly screw loosening adjustments they are very easy to make (don’t overtighten the screws when attaching the armrests to the seat). The other adjustments that can be made include the angle of the seat back, the tension it takes to move the seat back, the height of the seat, the height and fit of the head rest (I wasn’t looking for a headrest but glad that the chair has it) and most importantly for people with lower back problems, the placement of the lumbar support. You don’t realize how desirable it is to have all these adjustable features until you finally adjust them and sit in the chair. The chair was a cinch to put together, it took about 30 minutes. Parts were clearly marked, necessary tools were provided, two Allen wrenches. The fit and finish was excellent. It is a quality chair. But the most important consideration is how comfortable it is. One reviewer said he almost fell asleep when he was writing his review. I can see why, it is that comfortable. I wanted mesh for breathability and comfort and this chair has it. I don’t know how long these chairs are supposed to last but my read on quality putting it together indicates it should last a long time. Given all the features I think this chair is well worth the $240 I paid, especially when you look at well known brands like Herman Miller whose chairs sell for $1,000 or so. THIS IS A GREAT VALUE.","03 Dec 2018","","","Yes","Dbonds","5.0","Duramont Ergonomic Adjustable Office Chair with Lumbar Support and Rollerblade Wheels - High Back with Breathable Mesh - Thick Seat Cushion - Adjustable Head & Arm Rests, Seat Height - Reclines","/Duramont-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Support-Rollerblade/product-reviews/B0797HZ8W1/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Easy assembly and comfortable","As a person with lower back pain due to improper posture, I could really use an ergonomic chair to help me achieve a better sitting position. This chair does just that. I like the adjustment options this chair offers. I love that the headrest can be lowered, raised, tilted or removed. There is a little hex bolt on the headrest that allows you to lock the tilt in place, but I like to keep it a little loose so that it can conform to my seating position. The parts that make up the chair seem to be of good quality. I like the seat. It is soft, yet firm. It is softer than the harder office chairs, but firm enough to support you. The breathable grid-like pattern is also welcomed. There's a little knob that adjusts how much the chair is pushed into your lower back which is just fantastic. No need for a lower back cushion with this chair. The wheels on this chair are rollerblade wheels which I immediately switched out for the caster type wheels as I read this advice from other reviewers. The reason is that the rollerblade wheels work really well on hard surfaces, but no so much on carpet; which I have. Assembly is pretty straightforward - stick in the wheels to the base. Add the hydraulic mount. Add the armrests to the seat and then add the back. Then stick that onto the mount. I recommend getting a box or someone to give you a hand to support the seat when adding the armrests or the back to the seat.","13 Nov 2018","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LqWJjCTsL._SY88.jpg

"Smooth Rolling, Very Comfortable, Ergonomic Office Chair","This ergonomic office chair is very comfortable and has a lot of interesting features. Very easy to assemble and only took me 15 min. With my lower back issues, this chair can ease off that pain with a cushon that supports the lower body in which is also adjustable. And if you like to move around the area with your chair, the rollerblade wheels are easy to glide with on hard and carpeted services.

"It's the unicorn of office chairs, finally!","I'm so happy that I scored this quality chair over the Black Friday weekend.  I've been searching for over a year to replace my old fake leather old home office chair that I've had for almost 20 years.  This ergo chair is very comfortable because it's adjustable all over and has good lumbar support. Assembly was tedious because it comes in a lot of separate parts.  10 minutes to unpack it and cut off all of the protective foam, plastic bags, cardboard wraps, etc. but the chair did arrive fully undamaged so I appreciated the extra caution with the packaging.  The instructions are very clear except for one part about which  arm goes on which side of the seat .  You can't tell from the pic, even though the arms are labeled.  Of course I did it wrong and had to take it all apart and rebuild.  Duh.  Aside from that little glitch, it's easy to build once everything is spread out.  Adjustments are simple and as expected. I'm so impressed with how quiet and solid this chair is, at least for now.  I'm a big guy (6'1"" and 275 lbs) and this thing is so supportive and doesn't feel like it's going to buckle or anything.  I like the mesh back so it doesn't get hot.  The seat cushion is a bit firm honestly, but supportive.  Strong mechanism for tilt/rock and the casters are like those clear plastic old rollerblade wheels.  They roll decently even on bare carpet. A headrest was a must.  I sit at a computer for hours at a time for work, and leaning back with the ability to rest my head and neck is necessary.  This chair has an adjustable height/tilt headrest that is great.  I thought I was going to have to buy another leather chair again with a high back like those executive ones.  Nope. Arm rests are supportive and padded so they are easy on the elbows.  Good sturdy height adjustments too, so my hands line up perfect with the keyboard on my taller desk so my wrists don't ache. Overall, this chair is built very well and it's very supportive for us desk jockeys.  It doesn't squeak or rattle or feel like it's going to tip or break.

"Decent, comfortable office chair with a clean look","It was time to replace my mother-in-law's years-old office chair that has somewhat become uncomfortable to sit for prolonged periods of time, especially in the hot, California summer months. PROS - Clean, modern look - Comfortable for a typical work week - Mesh backing allows for heat dissipation and molds to the back - Fairly easy to assemble and took about 15 mins to complete - Manual was easy to follow, if you have built chairs before - Pneumatic lift to ease with raising/lowering the height - No additional tools required - Back pressure adjustable via the large, black knob under the seat - Reclines back to about 120 degrees CONS - Caster wheels roll smoothly, but have a slight grinding sound on laminate wood flooring when changing direction (no scratches on the wood, however) - Armrests are not adjustable - Recline lever does not easily lock TIPS - In step 2, you will see a ""50%"" marking for the ""(10)"" screws. That means you should only tighten it to about 50% so you can move the sidearms out of the way for step 3 to slide the backrest in. Once the backrest has been secured, step 4 tells you to tighten the ""(10)"" screws fully to 100% - For step 5, the height adjustment/recline lever should be facing to your RIGHT when the chair is facing forward - For step 6, the seat may not securely stay onto the vertical part of the chair legs until you sit on it and raise the chair up a bit Overall, this is an excellent, modern, clean-looking chair that is breathable and comfortable to sit in.

"great color chair","What a beautiful chair. It isn’t anything fancy but it does the job. During the installation, I had to remove the back screws of the handles to be able to install the back rest and that was the only hiccup. The installation went really smooth otherwise. Within 15 minutes, I’ve managed to finished the installation. It was quite simple enough that anyone can do it. What I love the most is the color. The gray color matches everything. The seat has enough cushion but not as thick but it doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable. It is comfortable to sit on and moving around in the office. It is a great chair.

"Decent, comfortable office chair with a clean look","It was time to replace my mother-in-law's years-old office chair that has somewhat become uncomfortable to sit for prolonged periods of time, especially in the hot, California summer months. PROS - Clean, modern look - Comfortable for a typical work week - Mesh backing allows for heat dissipation and molds to the back - Fairly easy to assemble and took about 15 mins to complete - Manual was easy to follow, if you have built chairs before - Pneumatic lift to ease with raising/lowering the height - No additional tools required - Back pressure adjustable via the large, black knob under the seat - Reclines back to about 120 degrees CONS - Caster wheels roll smoothly, but have a slight grinding sound on laminate wood flooring when changing direction (no scratches on the wood, however) - Armrests are not adjustable - Recline lever does not easily lock TIPS - In step 2, you will see a ""50%"" marking for the ""(10)"" screws. That means you should only tighten it to about 50% so you can move the sidearms out of the way for step 3 to slide the backrest in. Once the backrest has been secured, step 4 tells you to tighten the ""(10)"" screws fully to 100% - For step 5, the height adjustment/recline lever should be facing to your RIGHT when the chair is facing forward - For step 6, the seat may not securely stay onto the vertical part of the chair legs until you sit on it and raise the chair up a bit Overall, this is an excellent, modern, clean-looking chair that is breathable and comfortable to sit in.

"great color chair","What a beautiful chair. It isn’t anything fancy but it does the job. During the installation, I had to remove the back screws of the handles to be able to install the back rest and that was the only hiccup. The installation went really smooth otherwise. Within 15 minutes, I’ve managed to finished the installation. It was quite simple enough that anyone can do it. What I love the most is the color. The gray color matches everything. The seat has enough cushion but not as thick but it doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable. It is comfortable to sit on and moving around in the office. It is a great chair. The back support is there as you can see in the picture. It’s not the greatest but it will do the job. I hope my video will help others to get it install without issues.","31 Oct 2019","Color: Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817XHJtLk8L._SY88.jpg

I can sit in the chair for long periods with no after effects. It rolls smoothly and quietly. Its is super comfortable on my back and rear. I like how the fabric breathes-- so it is great for a house with no air conditioning. I wish I could use this in my car now. Took about 25 minutes to assemble by myself.

"Budget Chair for Home office","Bought this for my home office. Most of the ergonomic chairs are 300+. This chair perfectly fits everyone budget. * Sitting base is well padded and soft.

I constantly have to be mindful of how delicate the chair is before I sit in it. 6.

"A great chair for $50 but not more than that.","*Carpal Tunnel and Arthritis sufferers use caution. Allen wrenches are convenient but the one included is awkwardly long.* I purchased two of these chairs. The first one I put together as instructed. But I found it really difficult to attach the arms to the cushion with the back already attached. On the second chair I attached the arms to the cushion FIRST then I attached the back. This was much easier for me personally. 4 stars for value because the price jumped from 49.99 to 79.99 within hours.

"Not comfortable","After sitting for an hour or so, you realize how thin the seat cushion is - not comfortable after a while. I could live with that. A simple hack would be to add a small pillow. What I can’t fix is the arm rest design. The cross section is a “T” shape and therefore a small radius is facing your thighs. It’s hard plastic and not padded so I find this digging into my legs. Furthermore, the arm rest attachment point to the seat is rather far forward, increasing likelihood of touching your thighs. Maybe I can hack with pipe insulation foam? But 2 hacks for a brand new chair? I thought others should know before spending their money. I wouldn’t buy this chair again.  Easy-peasy to assemble though!","24 Apr 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","TomN","2.0","Home Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair with Lumbar Support Armrest Executive Rolling Swivel Adjustable Mid Back Task Chair for Women Adults, Black","/Black-Office-Chair-Computer-Adjustable/product-reviews/B00FS3VJAO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"It is  a basic $60.00 chair, that I hope my daughter can tolerate, for online schooling at home","So, first thing first, it is a $60.00 chair.  I just bought a $40.00 repair kit for my other expensive but older chair.  So, I need to put this in perspective. My 12-year-old likes the chair.  Mainly because it’s her chair.  But I can tell that the chair will fail her within the year.  When she sits down the cylinder already starts to compress. The seat cushion, well its not that good either, but it is a $60.00 chair.  I suppose that if someone over 140 lbs. had to use the chair, it would fail withing 45 days. However, It is a $60 dollar chair. After starting the process of writing this review, my other daughter will need a chair soon.  For sure, I will not buy this chair for her.  This purchase is just good enough not to send it back.  It is a basic $60.00 chair, that I hope, my daughter can sit in for 4 to 5 hours of the day.  It is nothing more than that.  So even at its price point it is a 3.5-star rated product at most.  Spend a little more and get a better product. Update, after two days of use, the chair was put in the corner and replaced with another chair that we had in the house.  Rating was changed to two stars..  The chair is just not comfortable.  Too much hassle to take apart to send back....  spend a little more and get a more comfortable product.","25 Jul 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","The Dub","2.0","Home Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair with Lumbar Support Armrest Executive Rolling Swivel Adjustable Mid Back Task Chair for Women Adults, Black","/Black-Office-Chair-Computer-Adjustable/product-reviews/B00FS3VJAO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good Chair for the Price","I got two chairs for replacements for my grown kids computer chairs.  It was easy to assemble. Take note on instructions: Don't completely tighten the screws on the arm rests before you add the back rest.  There's two tabs that slide into slots. You won't be able to get the back part on with the screws tightened. Other than the fact I ignored that, I did figure it out in a few moments. The chair is comfortable to sit on. I agree with some of the other reviews that the arm rests are too low.  All of the computer chairs I've had the arm rests keep you arms about parallel to the desk so typing and moving mouse is fluent. If I jack the chair up to maximum height, it's still a tad shy of this goal. I still gave it 5 stars simply for the fact it's a good chair at a good price and was easy to assemble.  If you're a power computer user who sits at desk up to 8 hours at a time, you might want to think twice on this one.","14 May 2020","Item Package Quantity: 1 Color: Black-fabric","","Yes","Michael Sharp","5.0","NEO CHAIR Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair Lumbar Support Modern Executive Adjustable Rolling Swivel Chair Comfortable Mid Black Task Home Office Chair, Black-Fabric","/Chair-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Comfortable-Black-Fabric/product-reviews/B087MZX9W8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Yes but No at least for me.","I like the back piece definitely is comfortable there but the seat itself really hurts the back of my thighs and side of my thighs like a lot. To the point where I am bruising after a day of use. This is less than 8 hours use considering I am working from home this is not comfy for a big girl or big boy. You get me. You got thighs and on the plus side I do not recommend this especially if you don't like your thighs being squeezed. The part of the tushy to front is decent on length but the part closer towards front is not comfy I have a bruise under my left thigh so maybe one of the screws were a bit to far in. The color is great the feel of material is great even shipping great I recommend if your a thinish to a little chubby person that likes a bit extra space not too much may be for you but a bigger person with thighs is a big no no if you want want to safe yourself from pain.","27 Jun 2020","Item Package Quantity: 1 Color: Black-fabric","","Yes","Joshua and Alya Garza","3.0","NEO CHAIR Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair Lumbar Support Modern Executive Adjustable Rolling Swivel Chair Comfortable Mid Black Task Home Office Chair, Black-Fabric","/Chair-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Comfortable-Black-Fabric/product-reviews/B087MZX9W8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

I went in every website possible Pottery Barn, West Elm, Wayfair & Overstock. The $$$ prices were just not for me. So searched in AMAZON and lo and behold! I found this chair! It shipped fast by Prime and received it in 3 days! I love the look and comfort of it. I didn't want to choose a standard black chair and decided on the grey and white color perfect for a woman. I was going to give it 4 stars because it took me an hour  to put it together (not the 20 minutes as the ad suggested) but decided to give it the 5 stars because I am really happy with it. Using it for the first time and I highly recommend it!","21 Jul 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eIaZ22fAL._SY88.jpg

"One Fall and It's Done","Most of us have been there: you're leaning back, bored out of you mind sitting at a desk for hours. Suddenly, you lean too far back and the chair tips over. Usually, it's no big deal. With this chair, it had just one fall in it. One fall, and plastic shot out from the back and the entire back snapped off of the little plastic inserts into the arms that hold it together. ONE FALL. Like, I get it, I'm stupid. However, falling in my chair once shouldn't cost me ~$60 because the chair couldn't take it. Honestly, it happens enough, chairs should be designed to take tipping over. It's going to happen.","25 Jul 2020","Item Package Quantity: 1 Color: Black-fabric","","Yes","Chris S.","1.0","NEO CHAIR Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair Lumbar Support Modern Executive Adjustable Rolling Swivel Chair Comfortable Mid Black Task Home Office Chair, Black-Fabric","/Chair-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Comfortable-Black-Fabric/product-reviews/B087MZX9W8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good value at $100 but could use a few design construction upgrades.","This is a great value for essentially the same chair you pay $180 or $250 for at Big Box office stores. There is an issue with the design though. I believe the manufacturer is assembling the inner infrastructure of the chair improperly. After about 6 months the back failed on me. I removed the leather and foam to inspect the issue. There are brackets that are attached to the wood with threaded nuts. This is a sufficient manner to connect the pieces however they have installed them opposite. Meaning the nuts are on the back and/or the bottom and the L brackets are on the top or front. Therefore when you sit or lean back all of the weight holding ability is bearing on the NUTS rather than on the brackets. I disassembled mine. I installed the L bracket under the base and the nuts on the top side. Likewise on the back I put the nuts on the front and the L bracket on the back. This increased the stability and durability of the chair 10 fold. Photos I uploaded show the nut that pulled through the wood and my repair by moving the bracket below. Now after about 11 months the chair is still working great. i find the leather material to be more durable than the office store type chairs. If the manufacturers would switch the process or contact me for more information on the chair engineering I could make this a 5 star review and a great value for a $100 chair.","10 Sep 2017","Color: Brown Style: Chair","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715XbVctaTL._SY88.jpg

"Chair is an epic failure","Here is why I am totally upset & disgusted with this ""office"" chair. First off,, the brown chair does NOT have a pewter colored finished -- it's more of a matte gold. That was the very first thing we noticed as we started unpacking the pieces. This turned out to be just the beginning of our troubles. Secondly, the screws for assembling the chair were too short. Whoever designed this should be doing something else for a living.  We still cannot get the screws to stay tight.  Basically, assembling this thing was a nightmare and we ended up needing THREE people to help finesse the parts into fitting together. Finally, after TWO hours of fighting to get the chair assembled, we stood back to look at our finished product and discovered a small tear in the back of the chair that we never noticed when we unpacked it.  Too late now.  Also, the chair's arms won't stay tight -- they keep loosening up because of the lousy construction design.  The chair is also uncomfortable because we're afraid to lean back in it or sit all the way against the back of it for fear of it falling apart. And finally, the little end caps, that are supposed to hide the screw heads, keep falling off because they weren't manufactured properly. It's too late now to send the chair back. Who wants the hassle of taking this one apart, packing it back up and sending it back? If I could leave this chair zero stars, I would. I'm going to contact Amazon directly about all the issues we had with this product.  I would suggest you pass when it comes to buying this chair until you have read ALL the reviews and viewed the videos that upset buyers posted.

There is alot of cushioning, and it isn't very hard to assemble, all the parts necessary are included. My one complaint is that, the underside of the legs of the chair have not been sanded or rounded; the five legs that protrude from the bottom have sharp edges on the bottom. This is not always a problem, but the other day I did manage to accidentally cut the back of my heel on these legs; if you're like me and you're using this chair at home  (and often barefoot because im at home) this could be a problem for you. If not for this sharp edge, it gets 5 stars.

"Amazon Basics Low-Back Task Chair VS. Hon Basyx HVL210","My office has the Basyn HVL210 and I love every minute I use that chair. I read many of the reviews for this item and I thought I'd give it a go. These are fairly easy to put together (took me about 15 mins), all the parts are given (you need a screwdriver) and even spare parts are provided. First off, out of the box, it seemed very similar to the Basyx HVL210, the materials seemed extremely similar, one review went about saying it was made by the same factory. I don't know that for a fact but the quality seems like that may be true but the quality of the mesh cushions on the HVL210 is better than these ones here's why - I occasionally cross my legs while sitting on the chair but with this chair the cushions actually don't go back to it's original form but rather deformed permanently (I am 155 lbs). The seats do go up and down vertically but the back is fixed. Additionally, both of these chairs have similar back support and they are good, nice, just the perfect amount of firm to support your back which was a very big deal for me! But there is a significant difference between the backs of these two chairs, the Basyx HVL210 has a somewhat contoured back so your body stays in one place where as this one doesn't have much of a contoured back. Again this goes for personal requirements for every individual, I prefer more contoured. As for sitting long hours on this, for me, if I sit longer than 3 hours at a time, it gets uncomfortable but then again very few people sit that long at a time and if you do, I'd recommend getting up and stretching every now and then! Overall, there is a 20 dollars or so difference in the cost of the chair. I did point out the differences, after this, it's all on personal choice. Good Luck!","29 Apr 2016","","","Yes","Buyer O1","4.0","AmazonBasics Upholstered, Low-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair, Black","/AmazonBasics-GF-60044-Low-Back-Task-Chair/product-reviews/B00XBC3J84/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Not as comfortable as I would like","Not as comfortable as I would like. I bought three different chairs on amazon and this was the least comfortable for me. The main reason is the straight back which is perpendicular to the seat.  If you are okay with a straight back chair, then this chair might be good for you.  I decided not to return it because I would have to take everything apart, put everything back in the box, and then drop off to UPS. I put a back cushion on the chair which helped a bit. The back itself does not move or adjust, but when you lean back, the back does tilt. . I bought this chair with no armrest (I prefer armrest) so that it can slide into an IKEA children's desk. With armrests, I would have to lower the seat all the way down in order to slide the armrests under the chair, but the seat would be too low. The other two chairs I bought on amazon were the Belleze Desk Office Chair Mid Back Mesh Ergonomic Computer Task in red and the Boss B316-BY Perfect Posture Delux Fabric Task Chair with Adjustable arms. Both were more comfortable than this chair.","14 Jul 2018","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IKR987q-L._SY88.jpg

"Fastest assembly ever!","This chair was delivered less than 25 minutes ago. Since then, I have unpackaged everything (5 min), assembled the chair (14 min), set the height and tilt tension (1 min) and logged in to write this review. Each piece was packaged independently. The only slightly confusing part was installing the seat onto the base. When you put the support post in place, the white 'button' looking thing should be up -- that's what the chair seat connects to (I had the white thing facing the floor, which was incorrect). Aside from that, Amazon makes it SUPER easy with clear instructions and labeling on each piece. (which side faces front, etc). Even the bolts are individually bagged by group, with identification, with another bag containing an extra of each bolt. Granted, I've only been sitting for long enough to type this review, but the chair is reasonably comfortable. The back padding is substantial, as is the seat itself. Surely I could have found a better chair if I wanted to spend the time trying them out at Staples, but for my money and time, this is the very best I could imagine it would be.","29 Sep 2017","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Lv6kn2x9L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Brooke C","5.0","AmazonBasics Upholstered, Low-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair, Black","/AmazonBasics-GF-60044-Low-Back-Task-Chair/product-reviews/B00XBC3J84/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Attractively priced and functions like an office chair","Chair is easy to put together.  It's an obvious Staples product that is rebranded (parts kit has Staples branding), but nonetheless I do not see a chair on the Staples website that is this affordable with the same review quality.

"My wife needed this chair to work at the Kitchen table, looks great too!","For the little amount of money, I wasn't expected much. I bought this under PRIME and shipped to my door FREE.

It's very, very sturdy. Oh yeah, talk about fast, order it one day, practically comes the next day! Maybe it's because Amazon now has a 20 football field storehouse right in Fall River, MA near us now? Take it from me, sturdy. If it can be broken, I can do it fast. I would say that you might want to use your own screwdriver type allen wrench than the one they give you or wratchet-allen tool to tighten the bolts because a bit of twisting there. Easy directions, can't make a mistake. The longer bolts won't even fit in the smaller holes under the chair, so you can't blow it! Oh yeah, for the record, first time ever for me, I always marveled how they give you just the right amount of screws when assembling stuff. Well, this vendor gives you an extra small and large bolt!

"I really like this chair.. with one caveat.","I really like this chair. It's pretty comfortable. A vast improvement over my old junky pc chair. There is alot of cushioning, and it isn't very hard to assemble, all the parts necessary are included. My one complaint is that, the underside of the legs of the chair have not been sanded or rounded; the five legs that protrude from the bottom have sharp edges on the bottom. This is not always a problem, but the other day I did manage to accidentally cut the back of my heel on these legs; if you're like me and you're using this chair at home  (and often barefoot because im at home) this could be a problem for you. If not for this sharp edge, it gets 5 stars. I'm going to buy another one, because i do like the chair; but just know that it can cut you if you aren't careful.","29 Jan 2018","","","Yes","Zelkova","4.0","AmazonBasics Upholstered, Low-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair, Black","/AmazonBasics-GF-60044-Low-Back-Task-Chair/product-reviews/B00XBC3J84/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

Padding started to wear out with medium use after a month. After 2 months the padding was pretty much non-existent and it started to squeak pretty badly. I weigh only 160 lbs, so if its wearing out while I'm sitting on it, I can only imagine the longevity an average person would get out of it.

I have never before in my life used an allen wrench let alone seen one, but it was very easy.  I am a 55-yr. old disabled woman and get confused easily, but this is the easiest piece of furniture I have ever assembled all by myself and I have put together a couple of vacuum cleaners and a rug cleaner.

"Dont listen to the haters","Not really sure what the complaints are about this chair.  It does have a slight ""odour"" but that's like complaining about the new car smell.  The seat/back padding is GREAT.  The (easily adjustable) lumber/headrest pads are very comfortable and easily adjustable.  The assembly was easy/clean (no Styrofoam).  There were about 5-6 pieces (look at the pictures) all bubble wrapped and two boxes.  Inside of the two boxes, everything was individually wrapped.  And as a side-note... They have the EASIEST packaging to ""pop-out"" the various lettered screws/bolts/tools.  Personally, that was the first thing I noticed/enjoyed lol UPDATE: 1 1/2 months in... After using this chair extensively for upright gaming/work and full reclined movie viewing I can still stand by the 5-star rating I gave it. The chair always feels solid in any position (200lb+ guy) and the footrest doesn't feel flimsy at all if treated properly (ie, no excessive weight on it or being rough).  The only two very minor complaints are (A) it doesn't breathe at all so, on a very hot day and long sitting times, it can get a bit hot, and (B) the bolts for the armrest that attach to the back of the chair did work themselves loose that required about two full turns to tighten back up.  But, like I said, very negligible complaints for the price/features of this chair. UPDATE: 1yr 3months:  Both the seat and armrests are cracking.  Luckily their support team is pretty responsive.  Between the correspondences and the delivery of my replacements (today 8/20) it took about 3-4 weeks.  I'll be hanging on to these replacements until the seat and arms are so far gone since apparently they are only good for about a year.","25 May 2018","Color: Red","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n4W0MSBVL._SY88.jpg

"Cool looking, but functionally deficient","I have never had a cool office chair and decided to give one a try.  I ordered this expecting to get a comfy chair that was solid and supportive. I was able to assemble the chair easily and though this was going to be a great new addition to my corner of the world. Then I sat in it and that is when things started to degrade. 1. The lever to lower the chair is in front of the lever to adjust the angle of the chair.  NOT AT ALL fun expecting to lean back only to slam to the lowest setting. 2. The arms on the chair make it so you have to lean, uncomfortably, to adjust the chair. - poor design. 3. The chair does not have ANY spring loaded back rest lean, as in every normal office chair I have ever sat in. 4. When you want to move the chair back up, you need to adjust the lever, then manually move the chair (without any spring assistance) and then lock the lever down - all without messing up the position of the back of the chair. To summarize, this is a cool looking chair, and for some people it might work great.  For me, however, it is not functionally complete and will end up sitting in the closet or being sold on Craigslist.","05 Sep 2018","Color: Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kbGNNr3kL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Phillip L.

"Comfy chair, very sturdy, excellent features, but doesn't breathe and has a few minor annoyances.","Edit: I'm a bit late in editing this as I thought I did a while ago. I'm changing my review to a 1 star. I found the foam in the seat did not hold up and degrades pretty quick. Was probably 4-5 months before it felt like I was sitting on lumpy concrete and started to give me hell with my back. I also came to hate the fact the seat is huge almost for someone extremely big. I'm not very big so this was super uncomfortable. I know they are supposed to have a warranty that might cover this, but it'll just do the same thing again. What happens with cheap foam. A competitor with a more expensive chair makes a point of using high density foam. Probably ends up being closer to the foam in a car seat. That's what it needed. Have had the chair all of two days, but feel I can give a fairly realistic review in that time frame so far. Chair is super easy to assemble, probably one of the easiest I've put together. Took me less than 10 minutes which is awesome. Most chairs I've purchased in the past become a fight and can take 20 minutes or more of fighting them. There is a strong chemical smell, I noticed that the chair felt like it was coated in something. I grabbed a leather cleaner and wiped the whole chair down and besides a very light leather smell from the cleaner, the chair is odorless. Chair is super comfortable, the leg/foot rest is great. Easy to flip out and use. Feels very sturdy. I'm 205lbs and to no surprise the chair holds the weight fine and the leg/foot rest feels very sturdy. I really love the fact that reclining can be locked in place at anything between 0-130*. You just lock it in place and you're done. Have a few cons, hence the 3 out of 5. First is the chair doesn't breathe worth anything. It's actually pretty bad. low 60*F in the house and 30*F outside and my back and legs get pretty hot. I have a feeling this chair will end up unbearable in the summer. The armrests are nice but also annoying. They clear my desk at 0* and a very slight tilt, but as you lean the chair back they actually get taller before they then get shorter again due to design. Means that sometimes my preferred recline amount causes the arms to hit the desk. May not matter to most, but was something I didn't catch from the pictures. Its not end of the world. last annoyance is that the feet for the chair sit towards the back. I know this is to allow the chair to balance at a 130* recline position, but when sitting on the edge of the chair it tips. You have to sit completely on the seat. Again, not end of the world, but for some people I know this would be an annoyance just like for me. All in all it's hard to complain for the price, it's a really nice chair all things considered. Working from home 4 days a week this might not be the best chair for me in the end, but I'll have to be fair and give it some time and see. My biggest concern is the summer months and how awful that might be.","21 Mar 2018","Color: Red","","Yes","nosympathy","1.0","RESPAWN 110 Gaming Chair, Gray","/RESPAWN-110-Racing-Style-Gaming-Chair/product-reviews/B076HT2RFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Respawn-110: Perfect for anyone who stays seated for long periods of time & requires a footrest for when the floor becomes lava.","This chair is amazing! It took less than an hour to put it together out of the box and was very simple to do. The seat is firm and comfortable and allows you to lean the back up to a 130-degree angle and lock it in place at any point. As the back leans, so do the padded armrests in tandem. The addition of the footrest is quite nice and simply slides forward and back from the bottom of the seat when needed. Although, it feels like a lot pressure or weight shouldn't be applied to the footrest but if used when seated properly, there should be no issues. The addition of the headrest pillow and lumbar support are welcome and can be adjusted easily or removed if need be. Overall, the Respawn-110 Gaming Chair is a wonderful product and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to play games, watch movies, or browse the endless abyss of the internet comfortably.","15 Feb 2018","Color: Gray","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717EPcyLQyL._SY88.jpg

"Weak Cushion = Uncomfortable","I want to start my review by saying that I ordered two of these chairs, one red and one blue. They both arrived in damaged boxes, but a cursory inspection revealed no noticable damage to the chairs. The assembly was fine, with the only hanging being where and how to place the pillow on the elastic straps. It ended up at the base of the back and just slides down if not there anyways. I liked the look of this and wanted to spice up my battlestation with it, so I was excited to test it out after assembly. I immediately noticed the right arm was wobbly and assumed I had failed to tighten it properly. This was not the case, as it was firmly tightened. There was simply nothing I could do about this, so I have to be cautious everytime I push up to get out of the chair. After a few hours of gaming I noticed that the bottom cushin had defailted and I was basically sitting on the plywood base. It was and has been uncomfortable ever since. In the 2 months since I purchased this chair the left arm has started to wobble and the right arm is even worse. I have decided to go back to the cheap amazon basics chair because it was more durable and more comfortable. Other Thoughts: The leg prop is a novelty at best. It too is weak, wobbly, and poorly secured. The back pillow on the straps is flat and useless now as well, and I removed the head pillow because it strapped around the top in an uncomfortable position. So if you want a chair that looks cool, this is your chair. If you want one that isn't rickety and doesn't leave you sore, consider another chair.","13 Sep 2018","Color: Blue","","Yes","Suix","3.0","RESPAWN 110 Gaming Chair, Gray","/RESPAWN-110-Racing-Style-Gaming-Chair/product-reviews/B076HT2RFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Will I ever get my husband back?!","Well I think it’s safe to say this chair deserves 5 stars considering my husband hasn’t left the chair in a week.... well ok, he went to the bathroom once and I jumped in to see how comfy it really is, and yeah, I didn’t want to get out of it either. I was forcefully removed, though. He doesn’t share well. We call it the dentist chair because this thing can lay all the way back and adjusts in all directions plus the foot rest is awesome. Great gaming chair and works just fine at the computer desk as well. Just be aware that I am indeed giving the chair itself 5 stars, but my husbands household productivity has gone from a well earned 4 stars to a measly 1 star due to this chair. It’s sucked him in and I’m not sure I’ll ever get him back.. sigh.","30 Nov 2018","Color: Green","","Yes","OnWithTheStars","5.0","RESPAWN 110 Gaming Chair, Gray","/RESPAWN-110-Racing-Style-Gaming-Chair/product-reviews/B076HT2RFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Had to purchase extra bolts/nuts to fully assemble","The chair assembly was easy until I got to the part when I bolt the steel support at the base of the back of the chair into the steel support of the seat. There are three holes drilled into the steel support for three 8x20mm bolts that are included which require an included Allen wrench to tighten. The included bolts fit into the holes fine from the back portion of the chair to the steel support on the seat of the chair but there was nothing they screwed into such as a nut so they just immediately fall out and the chair falls apart and could not be assembled as received. I checked the instructions and it literally has an illustration of these bolts just going into these holes with nothing to screw them into to tighten the back support to the seat frame. They just sit there. The accessories are nicely packaged and clearly labeled so I knew I wasn’t missing any pieces, plus again the instructions clearly state I was doing it right which is insane to me, how can anyone put this chair together? I had to purchase three 5/16th (didn’t have 8x20mm/metric size at Home Depot so couldn’t use factory bolts) bolts/nuts and a matching ratcheting combination wrench to use with a torque wrench to install them at extra cost. This is why I’m giving just two stars. I had to settle for silver bolts because I couldn’t find black ones to match the color of the steel frame. After assembling the chair itself looks pretty nice. It’s a pleather material, feels fairly mid to high quality. Chair neck support fits me perfect at 5’11”. It just about fully reclines and feels comfortable and doesn’t look too cheap. I’m happy with it the look and feel. I’d give it 4 stars but I just can’t believe I had to purchase nuts and bolts to install it. It appears based on the instructions and illustrations that all of the chairs are like this, maybe I bought a manufacturer defect? I took a photo of what I’m talking about. The nuts/bolts in the photo are the ones I had to purchase and were not included, hence silver color. Again, I meticulously checked the instructions and box for extra parts and it was obvious there were none! Considering the extra 20$ I spent I may have been able to find a slightly better chair but probably not so it may not be a total deterrent if you don’t mind the extra work. Chair is sturdy, comfy, doesn’t look too cheap.","21 Jul 2018","Color: Gray","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wps0vOMaL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Theodore P.

"DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR. TAKE A GAMERS ADVICE.","I’ve had this chair for a few months, when I first got it, it was perfect.... then I actually used it for gaming. Within the first couple of months the arm rests have become wobbly on either side and have started to actually rip out. All I do is rest my elbows on them while I’m gaming (small amount of weight is actually used on them) They have bolts that you tighten to secure them but even when they are tight the armrests wobble and are extremely uncomfortable. Would not recommend this product at all. Wish I could get my money back, or a new chair.. also to add insult to injury the padding on the main seat cushion is like cardboard. Wears out within weeks.","30 Dec 2018","Color: Green","","Yes","CAC","1.0","RESPAWN 110 Gaming Chair, Gray","/RESPAWN-110-Racing-Style-Gaming-Chair/product-reviews/B076HT2RFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"220lbs guy) I wouldn't recommend this budget gaming chair unless those two things get ...","Honestly this chair has everything going for it except 2 major things. 1) the arm rest wobble side to side but not up and down. Can support arms but feels flimsy. 2) the seat cushion deflated really quickly (<20 days) and isn't as supportive as hoped for. (Preface: I'm a 6' tall, 220lbs guy) Update: after 7 months of ownership, the material on the chair has begun to split and separate leaving a pealing effect. I wouldn't recommend this budget gaming chair unless those two things get fixed in future versions.","25 Aug 2018","Color: Gray","","Yes","Ryan Manning","2.0","RESPAWN 110 Gaming Chair, Gray","/RESPAWN-110-Racing-Style-Gaming-Chair/product-reviews/B076HT2RFQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Dont listen to the haters","Not really sure what the complaints are about this chair.  It does have a slight ""odour"" but that's like complaining about the new car smell.  The seat/back padding is GREAT.  The (easily adjustable) lumber/headrest pads are very comfortable and easily adjustable.  The assembly was easy/clean (no Styrofoam).  There were about 5-6 pieces (look at the pictures) all bubble wrapped and two boxes.  Inside of the two boxes, everything was individually wrapped.  And as a side-note... They have the EASIEST packaging to ""pop-out"" the various lettered screws/bolts/tools.  Personally, that was the first thing I noticed/enjoyed lol UPDATE: 1 1/2 months in... After using this chair extensively for upright gaming/work and full reclined movie viewing I can still stand by the 5-star rating I gave it. The chair always feels solid in any position (200lb+ guy) and the footrest doesn't feel flimsy at all if treated properly (ie, no excessive weight on it or being rough).  The only two very minor complaints are (A) it doesn't breathe at all so, on a very hot day and long sitting times, it can get a bit hot, and (B) the bolts for the armrest that attach to the back of the chair did work themselves loose that required about two full turns to tighten back up.  But, like I said, very negligible complaints for the price/features of this chair. UPDATE: 1yr 3months:  Both the seat and armrests are cracking.  Luckily their support team is pretty responsive.  Between the correspondences and the delivery of my replacements (today 8/20) it took about 3-4 weeks.  I'll be hanging on to these replacements until the seat and arms are so far gone since apparently they are only good for about a year.","25 May 2018","Color: Red","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71n4W0MSBVL._SY88.jpg

"Cool looking, but functionally deficient","I have never had a cool office chair and decided to give one a try.  I ordered this expecting to get a comfy chair that was solid and supportive. I was able to assemble the chair easily and though this was going to be a great new addition to my corner of the world. Then I sat in it and that is when things started to degrade. 1. The lever to lower the chair is in front of the lever to adjust the angle of the chair.  NOT AT ALL fun expecting to lean back only to slam to the lowest setting. 2. The arms on the chair make it so you have to lean, uncomfortably, to adjust the chair. - poor design. 3. The chair does not have ANY spring loaded back rest lean, as in every normal office chair I have ever sat in. 4. When you want to move the chair back up, you need to adjust the lever, then manually move the chair (without any spring assistance) and then lock the lever down - all without messing up the position of the back of the chair. To summarize, this is a cool looking chair, and for some people it might work great.  For me, however, it is not functionally complete and will end up sitting in the closet or being sold on Craigslist.","05 Sep 2018","Color: Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kbGNNr3kL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Phillip L.

I have a feeling this chair will end up unbearable in the summer. The armrests are nice but also annoying. They clear my desk at 0* and a very slight tilt, but as you lean the chair back they actually get taller before they then get shorter again due to design. Means that sometimes my preferred recline amount causes the arms to hit the desk. May not matter to most, but was something I didn't catch from the pictures.

"Do Not Buy!","I purchased one of these chairs back in August of 2017 and it has been amazing, but the seat has gotten a little worn so I just ordered a new one (September 2019). I was SO DISAPPOINTED when I got it all put together-- it looks the same, but it is a cheap version that is literally too uncomfortable to sit in. The metals posts that support the back are shorter, the back now needs to be screwed on (the old version is permanently connected); the edging that goes around the back has been removed (and is sharp); the mesh is rougher; and the wheels dont fit flush to the base, which cause a wobble ( see photos ). I would have packaged it all up to return already, except that adjustable shaft is now stuck in the base and the chair -- I've had to call in a favor to have a second person come and help me pull it apart tomorrow. It is so disappointing on every level possible, and I'll definitely think twice before purchasing another piece of Amazon Basics furniture.","30 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71laL+-yKpL._SY88.jpg

I call that a win. I happen to think it's actually really comfortable especially considering how cheap it was. Looks nice enough and It was super easy to assemble. Seems pretty durable. I've spent entire days in this chair working and so far not one backache.","07 Apr 2017","","","Yes","tourdm","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Does not age well","I've owned it for a year so this review is based on long term results as the comfort has changed since I first put it together.  The cushion is now maybe 20% the thickness it once was, at least in the spots I most frequently sit.  I find myself rotating positions as my butt gets tired and back starts to ache. The armrests are hard plastic, would like to see some sort of softer material used instead. Back support is probably the highlight (despite my back feeling sore on occasion, I think that is due to awkward positions necessitated out of discomfort from below). The chair is available for a great price, but after a year I'm already starting to shop around.  My guess is you get what you pay for, and I plan on a significant upgrade.","27 Apr 2017","","","Yes","W.

"Overall great chair with room for a armrest improvements","Overall I like this chair, especially for the price.  Assembly was a breeze.  All parts were clearly labeled.  Whomever packaged the parts and wrote the assembly instruction booklet couldn't have made it more clear and easy.  (A rarity.) I find the cushion to be comfortable and of medium firmness.  I would've paid more if the arm height was adjustable, or if at a minimum were able to be lifted out of the way against the back of the chair making the chair essentially armless.  I find the fixed arms to be about an inch too low, but if I am just sitting back, relaxing in the chair, my wrists rest on the armrest and it's better than nothing. The height of the chair was very important to me.  It was hard to find accurate measurements, so as soon as I put the chair together, I took my own measurements.  I hope someone else will find it helpful.... The seat is 19"" wide x 18"" deep.  The height to the top of the seat at it's lowest setting is 17.5"" and 22.25"" at it's highest.  The seat height sinks about 7/16"" when you sit in it.  Because the seat is rounded in the front and not perfectly flat, it makes measuring the height difficult.  I placed a thin piece of cardboard on the seat, then a quart sized paint can on top so it wasn't floating.  I then measured from the floor to the bottom of the cardboard.  I posted a few pictures.  (Sorry if they are sideways...they are the correct way on my computer and nothing I did uploaded them right side up on Amazon.) Floor to top of arm height is 23 5/8"" at lowest seat height setting and 28 3/8"" at highest seat setting.  (To determine if it will roll under a desk.  This is also difficult to measure as the arm rest is curved. I measured the middle of the arm rest.) Fixed arm height is about 6.25"" from top of seat to top of arm. Note many reviewers complained that during assembly of the back rest to the seat cushion, the metal back bar frame overlapped the seat plate.  They must have updated the assembly instructions at some point because the instructions clearly state, ""the metal back bar frame will overlap on the seat plate.""  They then show a diagram showing the overlap with another note,""back bar will overlap seat plate when aligning to holes.""  So, this is not a design flaw but intentional. Overall, I am very happy with the chair.  I use it about 4-5hr a day, 5 days a week.  So far after 3 months it is holding up well.","20 Feb 2017","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kCMEtrtPL._SY88.jpg

"A Much-Longer-Than-Needed Review for a Chair","I'm a big fan of amazon. I needed a chair. AmazonBasics had a chair. So I bought it. The thought of an Amazon brand chair was exciting to me. I needed an office chair and I wasn't willing nor was I capable of affording a Herman Miller, or a Steelcase, and so on. I've had $200 Staples/Costco chairs and they're okay, but typically not that much better than a chair such as this one. Rather than buying the cheapest generic chair from some generic Chinese company, it was appealing that a company that I have found to be reliable had their own to offer. Assembly: Out of the box, nothing was missing or broken. A booklet is included with very clear instructions and the hardware is separated and labeled in plastic bags; very well executed. One thing that bothered me is when you attach the back cushion under the seat it overlaps with the seat plate. I thought I did something wrong so I took it apart and put it back together for no reason, delaying the assembly process (I might have OCD). In the end, it doesn't seem to be a problem. Comfort/Functionality: The seat cushion is very thick and firm, it's probably my favorite thing about this chair. I LOVE THE SEAT CUSHION. Same goes for the back mesh, comfortable with good support. The pneumatic lift works well. The chair comes with a tilt lock and tilt tension adjusting knob, very basic. The caster wheels are very smooth. I don't really care for the arm rests, but there's nothing wrong with them I suppose. They are placed relatively low, my elbow does not even reach them so I don't use them (I'm 5'8"" btw). I'm guessing they did this so that the chair could easily be pushed into the desk without clearance issue. Again, this is not important to me but take it into consideration when buying. No complaints at all. The chair feels very sturdy, nothing creaks or rattles or anything. It's a solid chair. Summary: I'm pleasantly surprised by this chair. It definitely exceeded my expectations and I can see myself using it for a long time to come. It's a comfortable and sturdy, no-frills, no-nonsense office chair. Well worth the money. I really like the seat cushion... I highly recommend it.","12 Jan 2015","","","Yes","JL","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"A well-priced chair for Basic office need - LATEST review September 2017 with Pictures","Overview: 1. The chair is similar to another chair sold by Walmart for similar price. Its built and quality are acceptable for the price range. The non-adjustable armrests are made of hard plastic material so you may find it not really comfortable. 2. It takes about 15-20 minutes to fully assemble the chair.  Well-written instruction. 3. The chair can adjust from 17.5 to 22.5 inch in height (about 44-57 cm). Maximum load is 250 lbs. Detail review is as following: 1.Packaging: The product came in a carton package size of 10x23x26inch (24x58x65cm) approximately. Nothing fancy about this product packaging, the package looks not so study and protective from the outside. Mine actually came with one corner being deformed. On the carton, it says “Product origin of China” 2.Tools required: (1x) of a pair of scissors (or an utility knife) to cut the carton box open, and (1x) Allen wrench which is included with the package. 3.Open the box: Inside the package, the back support was bubble-wrapped while other components are in regular plastic bag. Although the carton was deformed, no components are damaged. Each group of assembly parts (screws, washers) are in separate ziploc bags with well-identified alphabet symbol for ease of locating components during the assembly process later. 4.Assembly: a.The instruction is well written with clear narrative and diagrams so assembly steps are easily to follow. It also comes with multi languages (English, French, Spanish and Chinese). If you have seen an instruction by IKEA (which assumes you are a handyman), you will indeed appreciate this product assembly instruction. This instruction is evidently written by American engineers  b.The assembly steps are logical enough so I could put parts together without any issue. Tips for you: (1) use the packaging bubble wrap and other plastic bags as your assembly surface to prevent chair components or your house floor being scratched. (2) Only hand tight the screws. Do NOT over tighten the screws. (3) Before you sit  on the newly-assembled chair the first time, make sure the chair is put together properly by checking on all screws are being tighten. 5. Final Result: This chair is fine for the price. The meshed back support is not really designed for ergonomic but it seems to be sturdy enough for its design intent. The chair height adjuster works fine, I measured and the chair can adjust from 17.5 to 22.5 inch (about 44-57 cm) in height. The back support can also tilt backward or forward based on your preference. AmazonBasics Mid-Back Mesh Chair","03 Sep 2017","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616F+4WuYHL._SY88.jpg

"Basically a perfect chair","As a relatively big guy (5'11"" 270lb) I really don't know what all the hubub's about on this chair being ""small"". It fits me just fine. It's compact without being too small. For a home office, this is a good thing. The lumbar support hits me right in the small of my back, above the belt line (where it should). It's well made. The arms are designed to fit under a desk. They don't provide forearm support when working, but I rest my forearms on my desk when I'm working anyway. When I lean back, the arms are there to support my wrists and give my hands something to hold onto. Assembly took literally 15 minutes. (I know, because I did it between conference calls.) I spent a LOT of time reading reviews and comparing various chairs. I finally decided to give this chair a chance and I'm very glad I did. It's a nice chair, not only for the price, but just in general. I wrote this review after receiving the chair, assembling it, and using it for a day. If anything changes, I'll update the review. But really... Maybe there are people for whom this chair wouldn't work. But it feels to me like a nice comfortable chair of average / compact dimensions that you might find in almost any office. One tip about the arms being too close together... The arms have slots in them for the bolts. So you can choose whether to snug the arms against the edges of the seat or allow a little extra width. I assembled the arms in the widest place in the slots. I recommend you do the same, no matter your size. It will give you some extra room in the chair. I'm picky. I'm not small. Price wasn't my #1 consideration in my decision. I like the chair and I'd buy it again.","22 Jul 2019","","","Yes","Eric Lovgren","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Cushioning barely lasted a few months.","Great for a few months, but after that the cushion absolutely disappears. I sit in my chair for 6 hours or so a day, as most people who work in an office do. It was comfy at first, but now it's like I'm sitting on wood. My tailbone is sore now that I keep sitting on it. If you want to replace your chair after 3-4 months then this will work. I was hoping to get at least a year out of this. Don't buy for longevity.","24 Feb 2018","","","Yes","Steven Irvine","1.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Excellent chair.","This is a very nice chair for the price. I especially love the way they packaged the screws, etc. Very clearly labeled and a big improvement, in my opinion, over the usual blister packs. It's quite comfortable for a 6' tall 175lb guy. Adjustment is easy, rolls nicely, all the stuff you want in a chair. I saw some complaints on here about overlap of the metal plates between the chair back and main support plate. This was addressed in the instructions in my case. Not a problem. I design machines for a living and I don't think this is a major issue, didn't impede assembly and helps relieve stress on the bottom of the chair if anything, I saw some pictures of the o-ring around the mesh coming loose. Mine did too. A couple of drops of super glue cured that, the rubber ring is strictly decorative in my opinion anyway. Glue it in, you'll be fine. Great bang for the buck! Would buy again and recommend highly. Didn't take anything off my 5 star rating because any objections I may have had weren't worth making a very nice, cost effective product look even slightly bad over trivial BS.","13 Mar 2018","","","Yes","Scott Drager","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Do Not Buy!","I purchased one of these chairs back in August of 2017 and it has been amazing, but the seat has gotten a little worn so I just ordered a new one (September 2019). I was SO DISAPPOINTED when I got it all put together-- it looks the same, but it is a cheap version that is literally too uncomfortable to sit in. The metals posts that support the back are shorter, the back now needs to be screwed on (the old version is permanently connected); the edging that goes around the back has been removed (and is sharp); the mesh is rougher; and the wheels dont fit flush to the base, which cause a wobble ( see photos ). I would have packaged it all up to return already, except that adjustable shaft is now stuck in the base and the chair -- I've had to call in a favor to have a second person come and help me pull it apart tomorrow. It is so disappointing on every level possible, and I'll definitely think twice before purchasing another piece of Amazon Basics furniture.","30 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71laL+-yKpL._SY88.jpg

"Basically a perfect chair","As a relatively big guy (5'11"" 270lb) I really don't know what all the hubub's about on this chair being ""small"". It fits me just fine. It's compact without being too small. For a home office, this is a good thing. The lumbar support hits me right in the small of my back, above the belt line (where it should). It's well made. The arms are designed to fit under a desk. They don't provide forearm support when working, but I rest my forearms on my desk when I'm working anyway. When I lean back, the arms are there to support my wrists and give my hands something to hold onto. Assembly took literally 15 minutes. (I know, because I did it between conference calls.) I spent a LOT of time reading reviews and comparing various chairs. I finally decided to give this chair a chance and I'm very glad I did. It's a nice chair, not only for the price, but just in general. I wrote this review after receiving the chair, assembling it, and using it for a day. If anything changes, I'll update the review. But really... Maybe there are people for whom this chair wouldn't work. But it feels to me like a nice comfortable chair of average / compact dimensions that you might find in almost any office. One tip about the arms being too close together... The arms have slots in them for the bolts. So you can choose whether to snug the arms against the edges of the seat or allow a little extra width. I assembled the arms in the widest place in the slots. I recommend you do the same, no matter your size. It will give you some extra room in the chair. I'm picky. I'm not small. Price wasn't my #1 consideration in my decision. I like the chair and I'd buy it again.","22 Jul 2019","","","Yes","Eric Lovgren","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Cushioning barely lasted a few months.","Great for a few months, but after that the cushion absolutely disappears. I sit in my chair for 6 hours or so a day, as most people who work in an office do. It was comfy at first, but now it's like I'm sitting on wood. My tailbone is sore now that I keep sitting on it. If you want to replace your chair after 3-4 months then this will work. I was hoping to get at least a year out of this. Don't buy for longevity.","24 Feb 2018","","","Yes","Steven Irvine","1.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Excellent chair.","This is a very nice chair for the price. I especially love the way they packaged the screws, etc. Very clearly labeled and a big improvement, in my opinion, over the usual blister packs. It's quite comfortable for a 6' tall 175lb guy. Adjustment is easy, rolls nicely, all the stuff you want in a chair. I saw some complaints on here about overlap of the metal plates between the chair back and main support plate. This was addressed in the instructions in my case. Not a problem. I design machines for a living and I don't think this is a major issue, didn't impede assembly and helps relieve stress on the bottom of the chair if anything, I saw some pictures of the o-ring around the mesh coming loose. Mine did too. A couple of drops of super glue cured that, the rubber ring is strictly decorative in my opinion anyway. Glue it in, you'll be fine. Great bang for the buck! Would buy again and recommend highly. Didn't take anything off my 5 star rating because any objections I may have had weren't worth making a very nice, cost effective product look even slightly bad over trivial BS.","13 Mar 2018","","","Yes","Scott Drager","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"I really like this chair.. with one caveat.","I really like this chair. It's pretty comfortable. A vast improvement over my old junky pc chair. There is alot of cushioning, and it isn't very hard to assemble, all the parts necessary are included. My one complaint is that, the underside of the legs of the chair have not been sanded or rounded; the five legs that protrude from the bottom have sharp edges on the bottom. This is not always a problem, but the other day I did manage to accidentally cut the back of my heel on these legs; if you're like me and you're using this chair at home  (and often barefoot because im at home) this could be a problem for you. If not for this sharp edge, it gets 5 stars. I'm going to buy another one, because i do like the chair; but just know that it can cut you if you aren't careful.","29 Jan 2018","","","Yes","Zelkova","4.0","AmazonBasics Upholstered, Low-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair, Black","/AmazonBasics-GF-60044-Low-Back-Task-Chair/product-reviews/B00XBC3J84/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Amazon Basics Low-Back Task Chair VS. Hon Basyx HVL210","My office has the Basyn HVL210 and I love every minute I use that chair. I read many of the reviews for this item and I thought I'd give it a go. These are fairly easy to put together (took me about 15 mins), all the parts are given (you need a screwdriver) and even spare parts are provided. First off, out of the box, it seemed very similar to the Basyx HVL210, the materials seemed extremely similar, one review went about saying it was made by the same factory. I don't know that for a fact but the quality seems like that may be true but the quality of the mesh cushions on the HVL210 is better than these ones here's why - I occasionally cross my legs while sitting on the chair but with this chair the cushions actually don't go back to it's original form but rather deformed permanently (I am 155 lbs). The seats do go up and down vertically but the back is fixed. Additionally, both of these chairs have similar back support and they are good, nice, just the perfect amount of firm to support your back which was a very big deal for me! But there is a significant difference between the backs of these two chairs, the Basyx HVL210 has a somewhat contoured back so your body stays in one place where as this one doesn't have much of a contoured back. Again this goes for personal requirements for every individual, I prefer more contoured. As for sitting long hours on this, for me, if I sit longer than 3 hours at a time, it gets uncomfortable but then again very few people sit that long at a time and if you do, I'd recommend getting up and stretching every now and then! Overall, there is a 20 dollars or so difference in the cost of the chair. I did point out the differences, after this, it's all on personal choice. Good Luck!","29 Apr 2016","","","Yes","Buyer O1","4.0","AmazonBasics Upholstered, Low-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair, Black","/AmazonBasics-GF-60044-Low-Back-Task-Chair/product-reviews/B00XBC3J84/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Not as comfortable as I would like","Not as comfortable as I would like. I bought three different chairs on amazon and this was the least comfortable for me. The main reason is the straight back which is perpendicular to the seat.  If you are okay with a straight back chair, then this chair might be good for you.  I decided not to return it because I would have to take everything apart, put everything back in the box, and then drop off to UPS. I put a back cushion on the chair which helped a bit. The back itself does not move or adjust, but when you lean back, the back does tilt. . I bought this chair with no armrest (I prefer armrest) so that it can slide into an IKEA children's desk. With armrests, I would have to lower the seat all the way down in order to slide the armrests under the chair, but the seat would be too low. The other two chairs I bought on amazon were the Belleze Desk Office Chair Mid Back Mesh Ergonomic Computer Task in red and the Boss B316-BY Perfect Posture Delux Fabric Task Chair with Adjustable arms. Both were more comfortable than this chair.","14 Jul 2018","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IKR987q-L._SY88.jpg

"Fastest assembly ever!","This chair was delivered less than 25 minutes ago. Since then, I have unpackaged everything (5 min), assembled the chair (14 min), set the height and tilt tension (1 min) and logged in to write this review. Each piece was packaged independently. The only slightly confusing part was installing the seat onto the base. When you put the support post in place, the white 'button' looking thing should be up -- that's what the chair seat connects to (I had the white thing facing the floor, which was incorrect). Aside from that, Amazon makes it SUPER easy with clear instructions and labeling on each piece. (which side faces front, etc). Even the bolts are individually bagged by group, with identification, with another bag containing an extra of each bolt. Granted, I've only been sitting for long enough to type this review, but the chair is reasonably comfortable. The back padding is substantial, as is the seat itself.

Maybe it's because Amazon now has a 20 football field storehouse right in Fall River, MA near us now? Take it from me, sturdy. If it can be broken, I can do it fast. I would say that you might want to use your own screwdriver type allen wrench than the one they give you or wratchet-allen tool to tighten the bolts because a bit of twisting there. Easy directions, can't make a mistake. The longer bolts won't even fit in the smaller holes under the chair, so you can't blow it!

Now I have to pay taxes in RI, as RI is the worst state in the country to do business, but it's chump change and what's more, the quality is on par with a chair costing 3x as much. It's very, very sturdy. Oh yeah, talk about fast, order it one day, practically comes the next day! Maybe it's because Amazon now has a 20 football field storehouse right in Fall River, MA near us now? Take it from me, sturdy. If it can be broken, I can do it fast. I would say that you might want to use your own screwdriver type allen wrench than the one they give you or wratchet-allen tool to tighten the bolts because a bit of twisting there. Easy directions, can't make a mistake. The longer bolts won't even fit in the smaller holes under the chair, so you can't blow it! Oh yeah, for the record, first time ever for me, I always marveled how they give you just the right amount of screws when assembling stuff. Well, this vendor gives you an extra small and large bolt! The bag even says EXTRA bolts, lmao! Guess I'm getting old to find that amusing, lol.","24 Oct 2017","","","Yes","Robert Fagnant","5.0","AmazonBasics Upholstered, Low-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair, Black","/AmazonBasics-GF-60044-Low-Back-Task-Chair/product-reviews/B00XBC3J84/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Excellent No-Frills Computer/Office Chair","So far this chair is excellent. Nice and thick cushion on the bottom and good back support. It only has height adjustment and is very basic, but it feels well made and it is comfortable. I switched from an executive chair that had the splitting fake leather (only 5 years old, not the best quality). I prefer a chair without arms so I can scoot up to the desk, and the mesh back is much more breathable. I use this AmazonBasics chair for programming and development. It's not the kind of chair you want if you like to lean back and consume media on your computer, but for computer tasks it is great.

"Another great deal for the money.","I'll admit that when I bought this chair I didn't even pay attention to the fact that it said ""AmazonBasics"" in the title.  But as it turns out, Amazing must have contracted some Chinese company to build them stuff in their name.  And as such, you can bet that the quailty of the item will actually be rather good.  Why would Amazon put their name on garbage? This chair is a fantastic value.  It was easy to put together, came with an Allen key and all if the hardware was in small, separate baggies that were labeled and the instructions were very well written and very easy to understand.  I had the chair together in under ten minutes while moving at a leisurely pace.  On top of this, the bolts came with blue thread locker already on them.  I know that isn't a huge deal to most people, but it means something to me.  It shows they want you to have this thing in one piece for a long time. The chair looks and feels like something you'd have in a professional office.  The faux leather is well made and quite comfortable.  The adjustment on it works very well and over all, the chair feels like it should cost much closer to the $100 mark. Make no mistake, this isnt some $300 chair, but at the same time, it isn't trying to be.  I basically bought this thing to sit in front of our computer that we almost never use.  So, in reality, I almost bought it just to complete my office.  So, if you have a home office and want a chair that's very comfortable, looks good but don't care about the lack of head rest and don't want to break the bank, this is the one. I actually work in front of a computer all day long, and this is a chair I wouldn't mind having there.  I'd probably miss the head rest after a bit, but this is something I would use in a professional setting.","15 Jan 2018","Color: Black","","Yes","Grayson Gilman","5.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great For Occasional Home Office Use, Not For Full Timers...","I don't see many reviews regarding using this chair as a full time work chair.  It is probably because most companies provide decent seating for their employees, however just in case there is another that believes buying the cheapest chair possible for someone that sits in it full time I wanted to be sure that this review was there for them.  Invest some money in your employees chairs, they will be much more willing to work for you.  This chair is not meant for someone who spends a significant amount of time in it.  It has been a week and both armrests broke.  The chair has leaned to one side sine I got it and the seat back has never been able to be locked into an upright position.

"Chair arm broke after a week. You pay for what you get with AmazonBasics","Got this chair for my new apartment, and it was great for one week until the arm broke. I'm not a big person, 5'8""/130, so I was surprised when the arm just snapped when I pushed on it getting up out of the seat. I read the other comments about the padding and height, but since I'm on the lighter side I figured I could make it work. The back is short, and the padding is a bit thin, but both are relatively good at this price point. If not for this defect it would be a solid chair at a reasonable price. I don't seem to be the only one with the arm-break issue, just be aware of the realities of cheaper products. Also, it's annoying that the only options for full refund or replacement require you to send the item back - a desk chair isn't exactly the easiest thing to ship back. Update: Called Amazon, was able to get a partial refund and keep the broken chair, but was surprised that I couldn't just get a replacement part for the broken arm. I sort of assumed that since it was their brand (AmazonBasics) that they'd have an army of these things and their corresponding parts for replacements, but that's apparently not an option.

"DO NOT BUY. Extremely uncomfortable. Rigid, sharp edge just under padding, presses into spine around mid-lower back.","Possibly the least comfortable chair I've ever owned. There's what feels like a sharp, rigid edge, just underneath the upper padding (picture the edge of a piece of plywood) running across the back, roughly at the level of the seam in the middle of the back. The padding is completely inadequate and does not even cover the structural material of the chair. Sitting in this thing for an hour means back pain. After two weeks of using this chair, my back HURTS. For what it's worth, I'm not a big person. I'm 5'10 and 140 pounds. I don't usually have problems finding reasonably comfortable, supportive chairs. If you are large, or if you have a specific medical need for an ergonomic chair with back support... Or, if you're breathing. If you can read this, you need to avoid the AmazonBasics Mid-Back Office Chair.","10 Aug 2017","Color: Black","","Yes","Amazon Customer","1.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good looking chair, but weak armrest (read updates)","I cannot recommend the chair to daily users. Barely 2 days after assembling the chair, I managed to crack the right side armrest as I was shifting my weight to correct my posture; I barely weigh 155lbs and the armrest didn't even bear my full weight before buckling. It's such a shame. The chair looks decent, feels good, and was easy to assemble; it's just that the armrests are terribly brittle. Currently in the process of getting a replacement armrest sent out by Amazon (hopefully). Will update my review with how that goes. (Update) Amazon offered a 35% refund, a refund the cost of the replacement part, a free replacement, or a full refund. I decided to go with a free replacement. (Updated 2) It's now late June 2017 and the replacement chair is still going strong. I suspect the original run of these had weak/defective arm rests that have since been corrected. Overall the chair looks immaculate except for a few minor cosmetic defects: first the vinyl on my left arm rest has begun to fray, a problem that continued use will exacerbate until I patch it. Second, the screw hole plugs repeatedly fall out, they're simply too loose to fit snugly into their holes. Other than that, it's proven to be durable and looks new at a glance, so I'll bump this up to a 3-star product (original 2-star) as its proven to be durable.","31 Jul 2015","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EzXiuGDtL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Spartan VI","3.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Will last LESS than 6 Months. DO NOT BUY!!!","I bought this chair in April for my desk at home where I work remotely. I was really happy with the comfort & ease of construction for the first three weeks but that's when signs of wear and tear started. 1 month into buying this chair, the pleather started to rip off the seat cushion. At 5 months (as seen in pics), you can see how worn the front of the cushion is and how it's about to fall off. (This is WITH bi-weekly wipe downs too to make sure the white is still clean) I was OK with using this chair with a ripped cushion... that is until this last week where the bolts holding the back on have stopped holding. The screws/bolts are wayyy too short for this chair to be stable for a long period of time, they're less than an inch long and are barely long enough to reach through the frame to the cushion. In fact, I can't even get the bolts back in due to the chair back warping to my back. PROS: -was handy for a month? -elbow cushions are nice CONS: -wears extremely fast -will break within the first couple months -seat cushion rips & flattens within the first month -pretty sure it's not stable for bigger people, I'm 150 lbs and the back frame started to warp under my pressure. All in all, this chair would have been worth it with if it would've lasted at LEAST a year!! Instead, at 5-6 months-- this chair is a terrible choice & a waste of money since it will be going into the trash today. 10/10 do not recommend getting this chair unless you're only going to use it for decor.","30 Sep 2019","Color: White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41cQHKv4hSL._SY88.jpg

"THE BAD The seat cushion has gone completely flat and is ...","My review after owning and using this chair everyday for one year. THE BAD The seat cushion has gone completely flat and is completely useless after one year. Feels like I'm sitting on wooden bleacher seats. This is the reason I gave only one star.  The sole purpose of a chair is to comfortably hold your bottom. The GOOD The chair itself has actually held up very well. The back, arms and tilt function all work perfectly with no signs of wear.

"Small but sturdy, comfy too!","Very sturdy, super easy assembly, with clear instruction (words and drawings).  Parts labeled well and even a little packet of 'extra parts'.  We bought this as a student chair knowing it was not going to be as big as our large high-back office chairs.  It is small, but as I said, very sturdy and the lever to raise and lower is awesome.  Casters roll well and the seat and back are nicely padded and very comfortable.  Only down side is that it is a small chair so don't expect a big-guy sized chair.  Perfect for a woman or student with a small frame.  We love it.  The photo shows this chair next to our standard full-sized office chair.  The back on this one is 19"" from seat to top of the back.","15 Jun 2018","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-uoPXxpEL._SY88.jpg","Yes","jaime","5.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Another great deal for the money.","I'll admit that when I bought this chair I didn't even pay attention to the fact that it said ""AmazonBasics"" in the title.  But as it turns out, Amazing must have contracted some Chinese company to build them stuff in their name.  And as such, you can bet that the quailty of the item will actually be rather good.  Why would Amazon put their name on garbage? This chair is a fantastic value.  It was easy to put together, came with an Allen key and all if the hardware was in small, separate baggies that were labeled and the instructions were very well written and very easy to understand.  I had the chair together in under ten minutes while moving at a leisurely pace.  On top of this, the bolts came with blue thread locker already on them.  I know that isn't a huge deal to most people, but it means something to me.  It shows they want you to have this thing in one piece for a long time. The chair looks and feels like something you'd have in a professional office.  The faux leather is well made and quite comfortable.  The adjustment on it works very well and over all, the chair feels like it should cost much closer to the $100 mark. Make no mistake, this isnt some $300 chair, but at the same time, it isn't trying to be.  I basically bought this thing to sit in front of our computer that we almost never use.  So, in reality, I almost bought it just to complete my office.  So, if you have a home office and want a chair that's very comfortable, looks good but don't care about the lack of head rest and don't want to break the bank, this is the one. I actually work in front of a computer all day long, and this is a chair I wouldn't mind having there.  I'd probably miss the head rest after a bit, but this is something I would use in a professional setting.","15 Jan 2018","Color: Black","","Yes","Grayson Gilman","5.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

Chairs exactly like this one go for over 100 dollars at target and Walmart (I did some shopping around before I chose this one).

I have had this chair now for over a year and I also bought it for my brother for his room. Neither of us have had any issues with it and it seems to be great quality. The wheels have no problems on thick carpet or hardwood. My brother spends countless hours gaming in it and loves it! It’s large and I like to sit cross legged in it to help my back posture when I’m on the computer.

"Great For Occasional Home Office Use, Not For Full Timers...","I don't see many reviews regarding using this chair as a full time work chair.  It is probably because most companies provide decent seating for their employees, however just in case there is another that believes buying the cheapest chair possible for someone that sits in it full time I wanted to be sure that this review was there for them.  Invest some money in your employees chairs, they will be much more willing to work for you.  This chair is not meant for someone who spends a significant amount of time in it.  It has been a week and both armrests broke.  The chair has leaned to one side sine I got it and the seat back has never been able to be locked into an upright position.  This is a great chair for doing bills once a month (which given the price is obvious), however full time use doesn't seem to be its intent.","14 Jul 2015","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617LEx23saL._SY88.jpg","No","Marty","2.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Chair arm broke after a week. You pay for what you get with AmazonBasics","Got this chair for my new apartment, and it was great for one week until the arm broke. I'm not a big person, 5'8""/130, so I was surprised when the arm just snapped when I pushed on it getting up out of the seat. I read the other comments about the padding and height, but since I'm on the lighter side I figured I could make it work. The back is short, and the padding is a bit thin, but both are relatively good at this price point. If not for this defect it would be a solid chair at a reasonable price. I don't seem to be the only one with the arm-break issue, just be aware of the realities of cheaper products. Also, it's annoying that the only options for full refund or replacement require you to send the item back - a desk chair isn't exactly the easiest thing to ship back. Update: Called Amazon, was able to get a partial refund and keep the broken chair, but was surprised that I couldn't just get a replacement part for the broken arm. I sort of assumed that since it was their brand (AmazonBasics) that they'd have an army of these things and their corresponding parts for replacements, but that's apparently not an option. Silver lining is that luckily mine broke within a week so I was still able to get Amazon's help with the partial refund, but next time I shop on Amazon I think I'll be avoiding anything branded AmazonBasics.","19 Jul 2015","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XYbJME0yL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Calvin","2.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Unfortunate","Received chair and all of the parts for assembly are zippered into the back of it (unfortunately)- it makes little sense to do this. After unzipping the back I noticed one of the zippers teeth were missing and subsequently the zipper went off it’s track and came apart. I continued putting the chair together and figured I would try and deal with the zipper later. The chair itself was simple to assemble. However it took a lot of finagling to get the zipper back together and it will still require a dab of glue to keep its hold. If your wondering why I did not return the chair - it’s because it took weeks to get to me in the first place and I didn’t want to wait for the exchange as I needed an office chair.

It does start to feel hard after a few hours of sitting in it. The seat height adjustment is great to have and works well. I lower the seat to put on my shoes and raise it again while sitting at the computer. There were a few comments about the vinyl covering. It looks very nice and feels very soft. I don't know how long the covering will last. All-in-all the AmazonBasics office chair is a good value for the money. Be careful when installing the seat to armrest screws.

"Pretty but uncomfortable.","Easy to step up - looks gorgeous, but is absolutely horrible to use. After a month I can safely say it is the least comfortable office chair I have personally ever owned. The padding is ultra weak and ends up feeling like I’m simply sitting on the particle board which sits like .75in under the bottom part of the seat. I would avoid at all costs if you plan on using this chair for more than 30 minutes at a time.","28 Mar 2020","","","Yes","Erik C.","1.0","AmazonBasics High-Back Executive Swivel Office Desk Chair with Ribbed Puresoft Upholstery - Brick Red, Lumbar Support, Modern Style","/AmazonBasics-High-Back-Executive-Swivel-Puresoft/product-reviews/B07KXFJ12M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Screw holes misthreaded","This is a great chair, however I was sad when I received the last one in stock and two of the screw holes were misthreaded, so I couldn't properly tighten the screws that secure the chair to the base. This makes the chair quite wobbly, which is very annoying. I am sure if these holes were properly threaded this would not be an issue, but I cannot exchange the item because it was the last one. If it were properly threaded, I would give this product 5 stars hands down, but sadly I cannot.","07 Sep 2020","","","Yes","Brett Thigpen","3.0","AmazonBasics High-Back Executive Swivel Office Desk Chair with Ribbed Puresoft Upholstery - Brick Red, Lumbar Support, Modern Style","/AmazonBasics-High-Back-Executive-Swivel-Puresoft/product-reviews/B07KXFJ12M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Lots of Support for Very Long Hours","I ordered this chair because my recent office chair broke, and I needed a stronger and more comfortable option. I received the chair in a very well packaged box, with each piece carefully wrapped in either bubble wrap or cardboard. Assembly was very easy, taking me only 10 minutes, utilizing all their tools provided in the box with no need for my own tools. Once I finished assembling the chair, I tightened all the screws to make sure it was sturdy, and it was ready to go. The first night I had the chair I spent a couple hours on it doing homework, and with the knob in the first locked position it allowed the chair to keep me having good posture while also being super comfortable. I've also used the chair while watching a movie and playing games for hours, unlocking the knob and leaning back in the chair, allowing me to look up at the tv without any strain on my neck or back, and also providing me with enough comfort to relax. This chair is amazing for every use, no matter what it's needed for. It's very high quality for one of the cheaper options out there. I'll continue to use it constantly throughout my school year, for my many nights of long hours doing work. 10/10 Product.","02 Sep 2019","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FmhXEcMqL._SY88.jpg

"Brand New But Looks Good","This chair arrived a day earlier than predicted and very nicely packaged in a compact, high-grade corrugated box. Everything was well protected to eliminate any risk of damage. The piece-part HW includes 10 screws, 4 washer, and a decent allen wrench to tighten everything down (no additional tools required once you have the box open). The instructions are not excessively detailed but more than adequate for anyone that's ever put anything together in their life. It took me about 20 minutes at a gentle pace not trying to beat the clock. (If I were to race the clock on the next one I think I could put this together in about 7 minutes.) Everything goes together very nicely. The casters simply pop into the 5 legs and are held there with a pre-attached lock ring. There's a slotted tab along with two retention screws that attach the back to the armrests. It's a decent design and seems very stable. I'm not sure I like the fact that the armrests are not adjustable, but I knew that when I ordered it and they are at a good height for me once assembled. All in all the chair is very stable and very comfortable. I like the way it rocks back with just the right amount of pressure set as I spend a lot of time on business Skype calls and it allows me to change position when necessary. Haven't really tested the effectiveness of the built in lumbar support yet. I looked at big-box stores before buying this chair and the sticker shock forced me to Amazon. This chair is a GREAT bargain at $69.99 from what I can tell with only minimal use thus far. Granted... it's not a Herman Miller office chair but it is adequate for my occasional home office use and $400 cheaper!","12 Sep 2019","Color: Black","","Yes","Chopper","5.0","Office Chair, Mesh Office Computer Swivel Desk Task Chair, Ergonomic Executive Chair with Armrests","/Office-Computer-Ergonomic-Executive-Armrests/product-reviews/B07T1P5PMP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Sleek and durable chair at an amazing price point! You should consider it!!","This box arrived quickly and the box and inner packaging was in acceptional condition. The assembly was easy and the directions were clear to follow or any skill level. Once the chair was assembled it felt very durable and comfortable. We are excited to use it in the family office and it looks very clean and sleek as well. I recommend this chair to anyone looking for high quality at an affordable price. We need to replace a few other desk chairs in our home and this will be our choice.","06 Nov 2019","Color: Dark Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SwFvld6tL._SY88.jpg

"Great chair which does not take too much space!","This chair is exactly what i am looking for: easy to assemble, compact, and comfortable. Even better it is half the price I paid for my previous chair which was too bunky for my bedroom. The chair was neatly packaged and delivered with no damages. All the tools and materials are stored in the back of the chair. They even provide you with extra screws in case if you lose any. The instruction is simple and easy to follow which helped me to assemble the chair within only 30 min. I believe you can do it much faster if you follow some of the tips I list below. Overall, I am satisfied with this great product! Assembly tips: - 4 wheels at the bottom: Need a harder push for these wheels to be ""clicked"" into the holes. - Armrest: dont tighten the screws all the way as you will need to adjust the position of the armrest to be proportionate with the topper part of the chair.","17 Nov 2019","Color: Dark Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715YyZ+kf8L._SY88.jpg

"Good value at $100 but could use a few design construction upgrades.","This is a great value for essentially the same chair you pay $180 or $250 for at Big Box office stores. There is an issue with the design though. I believe the manufacturer is assembling the inner infrastructure of the chair improperly. After about 6 months the back failed on me. I removed the leather and foam to inspect the issue. There are brackets that are attached to the wood with threaded nuts. This is a sufficient manner to connect the pieces however they have installed them opposite. Meaning the nuts are on the back and/or the bottom and the L brackets are on the top or front. Therefore when you sit or lean back all of the weight holding ability is bearing on the NUTS rather than on the brackets. I disassembled mine. I installed the L bracket under the base and the nuts on the top side. Likewise on the back I put the nuts on the front and the L bracket on the back. This increased the stability and durability of the chair 10 fold. Photos I uploaded show the nut that pulled through the wood and my repair by moving the bracket below. Now after about 11 months the chair is still working great. i find the leather material to be more durable than the office store type chairs. If the manufacturers would switch the process or contact me for more information on the chair engineering I could make this a 5 star review and a great value for a $100 chair.","10 Sep 2017","Color: Brown Style: Chair","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715XbVctaTL._SY88.jpg

"Chair is an epic failure","Here is why I am totally upset & disgusted with this ""office"" chair. First off,, the brown chair does NOT have a pewter colored finished -- it's more of a matte gold. That was the very first thing we noticed as we started unpacking the pieces. This turned out to be just the beginning of our troubles. Secondly, the screws for assembling the chair were too short. Whoever designed this should be doing something else for a living.  We still cannot get the screws to stay tight.  Basically, assembling this thing was a nightmare and we ended up needing THREE people to help finesse the parts into fitting together. Finally, after TWO hours of fighting to get the chair assembled, we stood back to look at our finished product and discovered a small tear in the back of the chair that we never noticed when we unpacked it.  Too late now.  Also, the chair's arms won't stay tight -- they keep loosening up because of the lousy construction design.  The chair is also uncomfortable because we're afraid to lean back in it or sit all the way against the back of it for fear of it falling apart. And finally, the little end caps, that are supposed to hide the screw heads, keep falling off because they weren't manufactured properly. It's too late now to send the chair back. Who wants the hassle of taking this one apart, packing it back up and sending it back? If I could leave this chair zero stars, I would. I'm going to contact Amazon directly about all the issues we had with this product.

Uncomfortable, loud, and doesn't help at all to keep a proper posture due to its design.","13 Nov 2017","Color: Brown Style: Chair","","Yes","Ethan Martin","1.0","AmazonBasics High-Back, Leather Executive, Swivel, Adjustable Office Desk Chair with Casters, Black","/AmazonBasics-High-Back-Executive-Chair-Black/product-reviews/B00XBC3BF0/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Superb Comfort = Increased Productivity","For starters, installation took about 10 minutes without bumping into any problems. And, so far, I've had this chair for 4 months now and there is nothing bad to say about it. I am 6' 1"" and 195 lb and I work at home and spend about 8 to 10 hours daily sitting on this chair.

"Great value for a gaming chair, Why spend any more money?  Very quick/Responsive customer service","When I was first looking at this chair I saw complaints about it being too small for ""bigger guys"".  I'm a pretty muscular guy I'm 6 3' 230 pounds and the chair is wide enough and tall enough to support me. -The suspension seems solid and isn't being compressed too much by my weight. -The padding feels great, I don't feel like I'm sinking into it too much and it is soft enough so that my back doesn't get sore from long sessions. -The levers are firm and I can easily distinguish where and when it locks into place when I lean back the chair, I can almost lean the chair completely flat and with putting all my weight back the chair remains balanced. -The head and back lumbar support are adjustable - The arms will  fit underneath a standard size desk As long as you take the time to slightly tighten each side before going back to tighten all the screws it will be very firm. I had a slight problem with my chair and Homall was very quick to fix it. They responded within 12 hours to help me with a part for the chair. Overall I'm very impressed with the quality and presentation of this product, I've owned a DXRacer Chair in the past and these are just so close in comfort that I don't see a reason to spend anymore money.","04 Dec 2017","Color: Bk/White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711OQfrBmBL._SY88.jpg

Solid frame, fairly minimal padding (some brands offer more padding, but also offer to take more of your money).

"HOW TO ASSEMBLE && REVIEW!!!!","For the price, it's great. The instructions are completely useless! Here is HOW TO ASSEMBLE: The bolts come in 3 sizes which I will refer to as SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE as well as 2 screws. Make sure to test fit each screw by hand before just assuming its the right one!! This is what I did and my seat install was maybe 20-30 mins by myself! Step 1: For the base to attach to the bottom seat, use 2x LONG and 2x SHORT bolts. The 2 LONG go toward the front of the seat and the 2 SHORT go into the back. Step 2: 2x LONG and 2x SHORT. We will be attaching the back of the chair to the 2 side brackets. the LONG bolts go into the top hole, and the 2 SHORT go into the bottom. We now have 4 MEDIUM screws left to use. Step 3: 4x MEDIUM screws are used to attach the arm wrests to the bottom of the chair, and you can slide them in or out depending on what you want. Step 4: 2 screws left over. We put the plastic cover on FIRST on either side of the chair to cover the metal brackets. Make sure to line up the plastic with the hole, and while keeping the screw on the tip of the screwdriver making sure the hole is lined up, go ahead and attach these. Step 5: Go ahead and put the wheels on the base, and reference the picture to see how the hydraulic pump is attached. Just go ahead and push those wheels into place firmly, and push the hydraulic pup and then the base on top of it while they chair us upside-down firmly. Step 6: After going around 1 more time to make sure all bolts are hand tight and 1/4 turn, Attach the pillows and enjoy! REVIEW: This chair is an amazing deal for the PRICE. If you want more cushion, extra features, whatever, be looking to pay close to 3x the price. This chair is a huge upgrade from my previous office chair that was completely ripped, loud, and broken. Honestly, anything would have been an upgrade. For me, being 5'10"" and 175, this chair is extremely comfortable. Do I wish it had extra butt padding? Sure. Is that why I bought this chair? No. I game for 2-5 hour sessions normally and this chair offers great lumbar support via the pillow and the arm rests are super comfy. It's great for the price. 4 stars for now until more time has passed. Update 2/19/2019!!!! -The bolts have worked their way through the chair cushion, and now poke into my ass every time I sit down. It actually ripped a hole in my jeans before I noticed what had happened. See Pictures! -The other day, I was leaning a little back in the chair with my butt forward and the extra weight on the front part of the chair caused the wood to snap in half. This is the wood base that you sit on -Obviously this chair held up for about a year or so and just completely turned to crap. Buy a decent 100$ office chair. Not this. I thought racing chairs were better for some reason as I like them in my cars, and pro gamers use them.

"A Great Value for the Price","A great chair for gaming or general work at a desk for the price. The back is fully adjustable and can recline back a full 90°. The arm rests are alright and are a little squeaky, but do not need to be attached. The lever to lower and raise the chair is partially blocked by the left arm rest, but is still usable. The lumbar support and head rest are a great addition, though I find myself removing the lumbar support and just keeping the head rest. Mine arrived with a minor, but permanent stain on the upper back part, but nothing I can't deal with. Though this is my first high-end chair and I have no higher-end product to compare it to, this is definitely worth the price based on my experience with it. It is easy to assemble and a must-have for anyone still using a regular office chair. The flaws I noticed are rather small in my opinion and this is still a great buy.","01 Mar 2018","Color: Bk/Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718+fSglCyL._SY88.jpg

"#1 Best seller for a reason","I previously passed on this chair for something twice the price, thinking that it would be worth the investment. I was so disappointed that I went back and ordered this chair instead and have not regretted it a moment since. Not only does this chair look better but it feels great. And for about 100$ you can't beat that. One part showed slightly scratched but I think this is a packaging/shipping issue so I won't hold it against the chair as a whole (see picture below). The parts feel sturdy and the design is better than some more expensive chairs.The wheels roll well on my carpet flooring. The construction holding the back to the base with two hinges as opposed to one I feel gives this chair more leaning capability than some others. I always feel secure no matter what angle I set the back at. This chair is the #1 best seller for a reason. It is a great bang for your buck and a non-expensive way to improve any PC gaming experience.","12 Dec 2017","Color: Bk/White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61slNk7vQKL._SY88.jpg

"Good chair with great price but some minor issues.","I've had this chair for about a month now and these are my thoughts. Pros: - Easy to setup. Many reviews claimed it took them about 30 minutes, and it took me about that same amount of time. There's only a few pieces and they all fit together really well. There was one hole that was covered up by fabric, but a small incision remedied the issue. - Comfortable. This isn't the MOST comfortable office chair I've sat in, but it IS the best at this price point. The included lumbar and head cushion are a great inclusion but are a little stiff for my taste. Probably just need to be broken in. - Price. This chair is an insane value. Compared to other ""racing"" chairs I've tried, this pretty much is on par. The chair feels a little stiffer than other racing chairs, but the shape and seat feel pretty much the same. Cons: - Top heavy. Every now and again, I'll go to reach for something on the floor and manage to tip the chair over. This is due to its small base and larger seat. I'm a fairly clumsy person but I've never tipped an office chair before. - Non-adjustable arm rests. It's a minor thing and for me they are at about the right height, but it would be nice to have. There are other parts of the chair that aren't adjustable, such as how far forward the backrest is, but this is the one that stands out most. Overall, this is a good chair, but not a great chair. It meets all of my needs and works for me, but I could definitely see this not working for someone else due to the lack of adjustments in general. It definitely needs a break-in period before it starts to ""feel"" like an office chair, but once it gets to that point the chair is fairly comfortable for long periods of time. It's price is a major selling point and if you're looking for a ""gaming"" chair or just need something with a tall back like I do, this is definitely worth it.","06 Jan 2018","Color: Bk/White","","Yes","Alex","4.0","Homall Gaming Chair Office Chair High Back Computer Chair PU Leather Desk Chair PC Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)","/Homall-Computer-Executive-Ergonomic-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01MRZ02TL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"UPDATED REVIEW: DO NOT BUY! DO NOT! The company forces good reviews...please read.","Ordered white, got blue. One of the arm rests was backwards, easy enough to fix, but one of the pre drilled screw ports was misthreaded and cause the screw to strip on one of the arm rests. Didn't matter too much because even the arm rest that was installed correctly was loose after two days. Only reason it's not one star is because it's technically functional, but it's crap. I feel like i would have been better off saving up for the dxracer or a similar, quality, gaming chair. UPDATED REVIEW. Was two stars, now one star because of their terrible customer service. They approached me about my bad amazon review, good start, but they REFUSED to rectify my dilemma until I REMOVED MY REVIEW!!! You cannot hold reviews hostage, that's not how it works. I told them I would GLADLY change my review upon receipt of a proper working chair, to which they, again, refused stating that until my review was down they wouldn't fix my chair or replace it even though it's under warranty. I've never delt with a less professional company. I have transcripts of my emails and they are literally bullying me into deleting my review or they won't help me. I don't know if warrant laws apply in China, because upon deciphering they're poorly written emails they made it clear that they wouldn't budge. So here I am out $110, plus the warranty because they can't do business properly or actually help their customers without damnding they remove bad reviews. THATS WHY THEY HAVE A FOUR STAR RATING. DONT BE FOOLED LIKE IWAS!! Thy can suck it and eat my one star...and they're lucky I can't give zero or negative.","02 Aug 2017","Color: Bk/White","","Yes","dan hergenroether","1.0","Homall Gaming Chair Office Chair High Back Computer Chair PU Leather Desk Chair PC Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)","/Homall-Computer-Executive-Ergonomic-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01MRZ02TL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Regret purchasing this chair.  Wish I could've returned it for a refund rather than a replacement.","I bought this chair for gaming after a friend recommended it due to the affordability and similar design to higher end ""gaming chairs"".  The chair is comfortable at first but wears out very fast compared to chairs I've used in the past.  After 8 months pieces of the arm rest were coming off in small chunks.  After about 10 months the bottom cushion began to give at the seam and pieces of black material were peeling off all over the bottom afterwards. I contacted the company as the chair was falling completely apart in under 1 year.  The representative I spoke to said he would replace the chair if I gave them a positive customer service review.  Had they just replaced the chair, I would've done that anyway after dealing with so many warranty hassles in the past but it was rather odd that he made me put the review in before he would process the replacement. The replacement chair arrived about a week later and I kept it in a box for about a year while using an older office chair which I borrowed from a friend.  After finally opening up the replacement chair I noticed some slight differences.  It appears that they sent me a very similar looking but cheaper chair.  The little lumbar back support piece was already falling apart at the stitching before I even used it and the chair was less comfortable than the original.  I also tipped over in this one while leaning back and I remember the other chair having better stability.  This one came with plastic parts where the previous one had metal. I would only recommend this chair if you're on a budget and plan to use it very little.  If you plan to do a lot of gaming or office work with this chair I'd look elsewhere.  You get what you pay for I guess. Update: Realized that they sent me an older version of the chair on my warranty claim which was discontinued because the bolts poke through the chair into your butt.  I will NEVER buy another Homall product in my life.  I should've known not to trust this company when they wouldn't send me a replacement until after I gave them a positive customer service review.","22 Nov 2018","Color: Bk/Red","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61L-+M3lKCL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Jason McGarrity","1.0","Homall Gaming Chair Office Chair High Back Computer Chair PU Leather Desk Chair PC Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)","/Homall-Computer-Executive-Ergonomic-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01MRZ02TL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"A Great Value for the Price","A great chair for gaming or general work at a desk for the price. The back is fully adjustable and can recline back a full 90°. The arm rests are alright and are a little squeaky, but do not need to be attached. The lever to lower and raise the chair is partially blocked by the left arm rest, but is still usable. The lumbar support and head rest are a great addition, though I find myself removing the lumbar support and just keeping the head rest. Mine arrived with a minor, but permanent stain on the upper back part, but nothing I can't deal with. Though this is my first high-end chair and I have no higher-end product to compare it to, this is definitely worth the price based on my experience with it. It is easy to assemble and a must-have for anyone still using a regular office chair. The flaws I noticed are rather small in my opinion and this is still a great buy.","01 Mar 2018","Color: Bk/Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718+fSglCyL._SY88.jpg

"#1 Best seller for a reason","I previously passed on this chair for something twice the price, thinking that it would be worth the investment. I was so disappointed that I went back and ordered this chair instead and have not regretted it a moment since. Not only does this chair look better but it feels great. And for about 100$ you can't beat that. One part showed slightly scratched but I think this is a packaging/shipping issue so I won't hold it against the chair as a whole (see picture below). The parts feel sturdy and the design is better than some more expensive chairs.The wheels roll well on my carpet flooring. The construction holding the back to the base with two hinges as opposed to one I feel gives this chair more leaning capability than some others. I always feel secure no matter what angle I set the back at. This chair is the #1 best seller for a reason. It is a great bang for your buck and a non-expensive way to improve any PC gaming experience.","12 Dec 2017","Color: Bk/White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61slNk7vQKL._SY88.jpg

"Good chair with great price but some minor issues.","I've had this chair for about a month now and these are my thoughts. Pros: - Easy to setup. Many reviews claimed it took them about 30 minutes, and it took me about that same amount of time. There's only a few pieces and they all fit together really well. There was one hole that was covered up by fabric, but a small incision remedied the issue. - Comfortable. This isn't the MOST comfortable office chair I've sat in, but it IS the best at this price point. The included lumbar and head cushion are a great inclusion but are a little stiff for my taste. Probably just need to be broken in. - Price. This chair is an insane value. Compared to other ""racing"" chairs I've tried, this pretty much is on par. The chair feels a little stiffer than other racing chairs, but the shape and seat feel pretty much the same. Cons: - Top heavy. Every now and again, I'll go to reach for something on the floor and manage to tip the chair over. This is due to its small base and larger seat. I'm a fairly clumsy person but I've never tipped an office chair before. - Non-adjustable arm rests. It's a minor thing and for me they are at about the right height, but it would be nice to have. There are other parts of the chair that aren't adjustable, such as how far forward the backrest is, but this is the one that stands out most. Overall, this is a good chair, but not a great chair. It meets all of my needs and works for me, but I could definitely see this not working for someone else due to the lack of adjustments in general. It definitely needs a break-in period before it starts to ""feel"" like an office chair, but once it gets to that point the chair is fairly comfortable for long periods of time. It's price is a major selling point and if you're looking for a ""gaming"" chair or just need something with a tall back like I do, this is definitely worth it.","06 Jan 2018","Color: Bk/White","","Yes","Alex","4.0","Homall Gaming Chair Office Chair High Back Computer Chair PU Leather Desk Chair PC Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)","/Homall-Computer-Executive-Ergonomic-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01MRZ02TL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"UPDATED REVIEW: DO NOT BUY! DO NOT! The company forces good reviews...please read.","Ordered white, got blue. One of the arm rests was backwards, easy enough to fix, but one of the pre drilled screw ports was misthreaded and cause the screw to strip on one of the arm rests. Didn't matter too much because even the arm rest that was installed correctly was loose after two days. Only reason it's not one star is because it's technically functional, but it's crap. I feel like i would have been better off saving up for the dxracer or a similar, quality, gaming chair. UPDATED REVIEW. Was two stars, now one star because of their terrible customer service. They approached me about my bad amazon review, good start, but they REFUSED to rectify my dilemma until I REMOVED MY REVIEW!!! You cannot hold reviews hostage, that's not how it works. I told them I would GLADLY change my review upon receipt of a proper working chair, to which they, again, refused stating that until my review was down they wouldn't fix my chair or replace it even though it's under warranty. I've never delt with a less professional company. I have transcripts of my emails and they are literally bullying me into deleting my review or they won't help me. I don't know if warrant laws apply in China, because upon deciphering they're poorly written emails they made it clear that they wouldn't budge. So here I am out $110, plus the warranty because they can't do business properly or actually help their customers without damnding they remove bad reviews. THATS WHY THEY HAVE A FOUR STAR RATING. DONT BE FOOLED LIKE IWAS!! Thy can suck it and eat my one star...and they're lucky I can't give zero or negative.","02 Aug 2017","Color: Bk/White","","Yes","dan hergenroether","1.0","Homall Gaming Chair Office Chair High Back Computer Chair PU Leather Desk Chair PC Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)","/Homall-Computer-Executive-Ergonomic-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01MRZ02TL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Regret purchasing this chair.  Wish I could've returned it for a refund rather than a replacement.","I bought this chair for gaming after a friend recommended it due to the affordability and similar design to higher end ""gaming chairs"".  The chair is comfortable at first but wears out very fast compared to chairs I've used in the past.  After 8 months pieces of the arm rest were coming off in small chunks.  After about 10 months the bottom cushion began to give at the seam and pieces of black material were peeling off all over the bottom afterwards. I contacted the company as the chair was falling completely apart in under 1 year.  The representative I spoke to said he would replace the chair if I gave them a positive customer service review.  Had they just replaced the chair, I would've done that anyway after dealing with so many warranty hassles in the past but it was rather odd that he made me put the review in before he would process the replacement. The replacement chair arrived about a week later and I kept it in a box for about a year while using an older office chair which I borrowed from a friend.  After finally opening up the replacement chair I noticed some slight differences.  It appears that they sent me a very similar looking but cheaper chair.  The little lumbar back support piece was already falling apart at the stitching before I even used it and the chair was less comfortable than the original.  I also tipped over in this one while leaning back and I remember the other chair having better stability.  This one came with plastic parts where the previous one had metal. I would only recommend this chair if you're on a budget and plan to use it very little.  If you plan to do a lot of gaming or office work with this chair I'd look elsewhere.  You get what you pay for I guess. Update: Realized that they sent me an older version of the chair on my warranty claim which was discontinued because the bolts poke through the chair into your butt.  I will NEVER buy another Homall product in my life.  I should've known not to trust this company when they wouldn't send me a replacement until after I gave them a positive customer service review.","22 Nov 2018","Color: Bk/Red","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61L-+M3lKCL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Jason McGarrity","1.0","Homall Gaming Chair Office Chair High Back Computer Chair PU Leather Desk Chair PC Racing Executive Ergonomic Adjustable Swivel Task Chair with Headrest and Lumbar Support (White)","/Homall-Computer-Executive-Ergonomic-Adjustable/product-reviews/B01MRZ02TL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Quality, comfortable and multi-functional office chair","I ordered this chair about a week ago and I absolutely love it!  Given the Covid-19 situation I've been working from home out of my family dinning room for quite a few months already and I expect this to continue for some time.  The current chair that I been using was really part of the diner furniture set and it wasn't designed to provide much needed back support for sitting there all day long working in front of the computer.  This office chair is definitely the answer to the problem!  This chair has an ergonomic design and can be set with upright and reclined position (135 degrees) and any position in between.  During the office hours, I normally set it upright to work in front of my computer.  With so many conference calls these days, I would just recline it a little bit to be more comfortable while still talking over the phone in those long meetings.  The chair does come with some very smooth wheels so that in the evenings, I can move it next to my son's piano in the living room and watch him play while fully recline chair down with foot rest extended.  Just imagine how relaxing and comfortable it is! The chair was shipped to us in one box.  Everything was nicely packed and labeled along with a user's guide for easy installation.  The entire process took about 30 mins for me and I've shot a few major steps in pictures to share with everyone.  Everything was super easy and smooth, but as you attach the seat back to the bottom of the seat, I do suggest you switch the seat bottom and seat back for better support and easier alignment (vs. what the user guide indicated). Overall it was a great product along with good quality in materials.  I would highly recommend it!","09 Aug 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613UMzuOHXL._SY88.jpg

"good quilty！","Get this chair now! I'm doing to do my best to be as concise as possible and refrain from going on an endless rant about how much I love this chair.What I'm going to do instead is accurately and thoroughly review this marvel of modern engineering. First I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a 6 foot tall 280 pound military member with previous surgery on L5S1 which has left me with nerve pain every day of my life as well as problems on three other levels of my spine. Generally chairs aren't designed to seat a person of my stature and won't last very long. I require a chair that's very sturdy, adjustable and ergonomic. The box came, overjoyed I struggled to lift it into my apartment. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the box. It gave me a sense of assurance in knowing that I bought quality. The Hardware felt to be of good manufacturing. Also I received double the hardware necessary to assemble the chair. I LOVE EXTRA HARDWARE. The instructions were very well illustrated and the chair built in minutes. One thing that I really appreciated was the way adjustments were engineered into the design of the chair. While assembling you can adjust the width of the arm rests. Once the bolts are tightened down your arm rests will only adjust up and down. Another adjustment built into the chairs construction is controlling the distance from the seat to the back rest. This is generally only a feature on higher end chairs and I was happy to see that is has quite a bit of range. love it so much！🥰🥰🥰","15 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Erikchen","5.0","Hbada Ergonomic Executive Office Chair, PU Leather Swivel Desk Chair,Adjustable Height High-Back Reclining Chair with Padded Armrest and Footrest,Black","/Hbada-Ergonomic-Executive-Adjustable-High-Back/product-reviews/B085ZHK5LB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"First Class Experience When Working from Home","Chair has been an essential part of my life since working from home. My previous office chair is ok but not ideal. I am so happy with this new chair as I could adjust the back angel. Plus the foot support, it feels like the first class experience at home. The installation is been fairly easy. As someone who rarely assembles anything, the manual provides me a very detailed guide for me to do it. A picture is worth a thousand words. That is truly the case here. It took me less than an hour to finish everything. This may be a small project but the completion brought me great sense of accomplished. Now, I could be more than happy to enjoy getting my work done. Also, I want to mention that this chair feel very sturdy. When I pulled the box in my house, it took me decent effort to make that happen. I am happy to see my effort paid off and getting a chair that feels comfortable and sturdy.","31 Jul 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4116LCpAJ-L._SY88.jpg

"This vendor makes comfortable chair, which is easy to assemble.","Recent temporary 'work from home' has created problems for me since I have to move between different rooms in order to focus and complete my work, quietly. Unfortunately, this WFH will be a new norm for me from now on; my family understood my predicaments and was kind enough to convert one of the bedrooms into an office for me. One of the conversion projects was to purchase an office desk and a chair; the desk was a nightmare to assemble and turned out to be defective (shown in the picture). Compare with the black chair, it was not damaged nor defective; even though the shipping box could use some improvements. The box was torn when it arrived; luckily, components were intact with instruction manual furnished with pictures showing detailed steps to assemble the chair together. The instructions were simple and quick. This vendor was also kind enough to include some spare hardwares, which are very handy, saving a trip to hardware store since I have a 3 yr. son, who likes to hide bolts and nuts skillfully. I have used this chair for 4 days now; I found it comfortable and sturdy. It also has inclined positions with foot rest making it a plus. After dealing with the desk, which is much more expensive and it turns out to be defective, this chair is much more affordable and comfortable. I give it a THUMB UP and a 5 STAR RATING.","11 Aug 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712glg86kEL._SY88.jpg

"A good choice for my lower back","I am working from home a lot now due to the COVID-19. I wanted to get a Chair that is ergonomically right for my lower back. I developed this lower back pain years ago when I sat too long for a couple of months to prepare for an important exam. Since then, if I keep in one position for too long especially in the sitting position, I have pain in my lower back. When I saw this Chair’s offer of good support for lower back and ergonomics benefit, I thought I would give it a try. I have been using it for a few days. It seems to be a good choice for me. I hope you can see the angle of support for the lower back from the pictures. If you also have lower back problem from sitting for long, as I do, give it a try. It worked for me and I hope it will work for you too.","09 Aug 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711ncUl-+YL._SY88.jpg

"Do Not Buy!","I purchased one of these chairs back in August of 2017 and it has been amazing, but the seat has gotten a little worn so I just ordered a new one (September 2019). I was SO DISAPPOINTED when I got it all put together-- it looks the same, but it is a cheap version that is literally too uncomfortable to sit in. The metals posts that support the back are shorter, the back now needs to be screwed on (the old version is permanently connected); the edging that goes around the back has been removed (and is sharp); the mesh is rougher; and the wheels dont fit flush to the base, which cause a wobble ( see photos ). I would have packaged it all up to return already, except that adjustable shaft is now stuck in the base and the chair -- I've had to call in a favor to have a second person come and help me pull it apart tomorrow. It is so disappointing on every level possible, and I'll definitely think twice before purchasing another piece of Amazon Basics furniture.","30 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71laL+-yKpL._SY88.jpg

"Does not age well","I've owned it for a year so this review is based on long term results as the comfort has changed since I first put it together.  The cushion is now maybe 20% the thickness it once was, at least in the spots I most frequently sit.  I find myself rotating positions as my butt gets tired and back starts to ache. The armrests are hard plastic, would like to see some sort of softer material used instead. Back support is probably the highlight (despite my back feeling sore on occasion, I think that is due to awkward positions necessitated out of discomfort from below). The chair is available for a great price, but after a year I'm already starting to shop around.  My guess is you get what you pay for, and I plan on a significant upgrade.","27 Apr 2017","","","Yes","W.

Whomever packaged the parts and wrote the assembly instruction booklet couldn't have made it more clear and easy.  (A rarity.) I find the cushion to be comfortable and of medium firmness.  I would've paid more if the arm height was adjustable, or if at a minimum were able to be lifted out of the way against the back of the chair making the chair essentially armless.  I find the fixed arms to be about an inch too low, but if I am just sitting back, relaxing in the chair, my wrists rest on the armrest and it's better than nothing. The height of the chair was very important to me.  It was hard to find accurate measurements, so as soon as I put the chair together, I took my own measurements.  I hope someone else will find it helpful.... The seat is 19"" wide x 18"" deep.  The height to the top of the seat at it's lowest setting is 17.5"" and 22.25"" at it's highest.  The seat height sinks about 7/16"" when you sit in it.  Because the seat is rounded in the front and not perfectly flat, it makes measuring the height difficult.  I placed a thin piece of cardboard on the seat, then a quart sized paint can on top so it wasn't floating.  I then measured from the floor to the bottom of the cardboard.  I posted a few pictures.  (Sorry if they are sideways...they are the correct way on my computer and nothing I did uploaded them right side up on Amazon.) Floor to top of arm height is 23 5/8"" at lowest seat height setting and 28 3/8"" at highest seat setting.  (To determine if it will roll under a desk.  This is also difficult to measure as the arm rest is curved. I measured the middle of the arm rest.) Fixed arm height is about 6.25"" from top of seat to top of arm. Note many reviewers complained that during assembly of the back rest to the seat cushion, the metal back bar frame overlapped the seat plate.  They must have updated the assembly instructions at some point because the instructions clearly state, ""the metal back bar frame will overlap on the seat plate.""  They then show a diagram showing the overlap with another note,""back bar will overlap seat plate when aligning to holes.""  So, this is not a design flaw but intentional. Overall, I am very happy with the chair.  I use it about 4-5hr a day, 5 days a week.  So far after 3 months it is holding up well.","20 Feb 2017","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kCMEtrtPL._SY88.jpg

"A Much-Longer-Than-Needed Review for a Chair","I'm a big fan of amazon. I needed a chair. AmazonBasics had a chair. So I bought it. The thought of an Amazon brand chair was exciting to me. I needed an office chair and I wasn't willing nor was I capable of affording a Herman Miller, or a Steelcase, and so on. I've had $200 Staples/Costco chairs and they're okay, but typically not that much better than a chair such as this one. Rather than buying the cheapest generic chair from some generic Chinese company, it was appealing that a company that I have found to be reliable had their own to offer. Assembly: Out of the box, nothing was missing or broken. A booklet is included with very clear instructions and the hardware is separated and labeled in plastic bags; very well executed. One thing that bothered me is when you attach the back cushion under the seat it overlaps with the seat plate. I thought I did something wrong so I took it apart and put it back together for no reason, delaying the assembly process (I might have OCD). In the end, it doesn't seem to be a problem. Comfort/Functionality: The seat cushion is very thick and firm, it's probably my favorite thing about this chair. I LOVE THE SEAT CUSHION. Same goes for the back mesh, comfortable with good support. The pneumatic lift works well. The chair comes with a tilt lock and tilt tension adjusting knob, very basic. The caster wheels are very smooth. I don't really care for the arm rests, but there's nothing wrong with them I suppose. They are placed relatively low, my elbow does not even reach them so I don't use them (I'm 5'8"" btw). I'm guessing they did this so that the chair could easily be pushed into the desk without clearance issue. Again, this is not important to me but take it into consideration when buying. No complaints at all. The chair feels very sturdy, nothing creaks or rattles or anything. It's a solid chair. Summary: I'm pleasantly surprised by this chair. It definitely exceeded my expectations and I can see myself using it for a long time to come. It's a comfortable and sturdy, no-frills, no-nonsense office chair. Well worth the money. I really like the seat cushion... I highly recommend it.","12 Jan 2015","","","Yes","JL","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"A well-priced chair for Basic office need - LATEST review September 2017 with Pictures","Overview: 1. The chair is similar to another chair sold by Walmart for similar price. Its built and quality are acceptable for the price range. The non-adjustable armrests are made of hard plastic material so you may find it not really comfortable. 2. It takes about 15-20 minutes to fully assemble the chair.  Well-written instruction. 3. The chair can adjust from 17.5 to 22.5 inch in height (about 44-57 cm). Maximum load is 250 lbs. Detail review is as following: 1.Packaging: The product came in a carton package size of 10x23x26inch (24x58x65cm) approximately. Nothing fancy about this product packaging, the package looks not so study and protective from the outside. Mine actually came with one corner being deformed. On the carton, it says “Product origin of China” 2.Tools required: (1x) of a pair of scissors (or an utility knife) to cut the carton box open, and (1x) Allen wrench which is included with the package. 3.Open the box: Inside the package, the back support was bubble-wrapped while other components are in regular plastic bag. Although the carton was deformed, no components are damaged. Each group of assembly parts (screws, washers) are in separate ziploc bags with well-identified alphabet symbol for ease of locating components during the assembly process later. 4.Assembly: a.The instruction is well written with clear narrative and diagrams so assembly steps are easily to follow. It also comes with multi languages (English, French, Spanish and Chinese). If you have seen an instruction by IKEA (which assumes you are a handyman), you will indeed appreciate this product assembly instruction. This instruction is evidently written by American engineers  b.The assembly steps are logical enough so I could put parts together without any issue. Tips for you: (1) use the packaging bubble wrap and other plastic bags as your assembly surface to prevent chair components or your house floor being scratched. (2) Only hand tight the screws. Do NOT over tighten the screws. (3) Before you sit  on the newly-assembled chair the first time, make sure the chair is put together properly by checking on all screws are being tighten. 5. Final Result: This chair is fine for the price. The meshed back support is not really designed for ergonomic but it seems to be sturdy enough for its design intent. The chair height adjuster works fine, I measured and the chair can adjust from 17.5 to 22.5 inch (about 44-57 cm) in height. The back support can also tilt backward or forward based on your preference. AmazonBasics Mid-Back Mesh Chair","03 Sep 2017","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616F+4WuYHL._SY88.jpg

"Basically a perfect chair","As a relatively big guy (5'11"" 270lb) I really don't know what all the hubub's about on this chair being ""small"". It fits me just fine. It's compact without being too small. For a home office, this is a good thing. The lumbar support hits me right in the small of my back, above the belt line (where it should). It's well made. The arms are designed to fit under a desk. They don't provide forearm support when working, but I rest my forearms on my desk when I'm working anyway. When I lean back, the arms are there to support my wrists and give my hands something to hold onto. Assembly took literally 15 minutes. (I know, because I did it between conference calls.) I spent a LOT of time reading reviews and comparing various chairs. I finally decided to give this chair a chance and I'm very glad I did. It's a nice chair, not only for the price, but just in general. I wrote this review after receiving the chair, assembling it, and using it for a day. If anything changes, I'll update the review. But really... Maybe there are people for whom this chair wouldn't work. But it feels to me like a nice comfortable chair of average / compact dimensions that you might find in almost any office. One tip about the arms being too close together... The arms have slots in them for the bolts. So you can choose whether to snug the arms against the edges of the seat or allow a little extra width. I assembled the arms in the widest place in the slots. I recommend you do the same, no matter your size. It will give you some extra room in the chair. I'm picky. I'm not small. Price wasn't my #1 consideration in my decision. I like the chair and I'd buy it again.","22 Jul 2019","","","Yes","Eric Lovgren","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Cushioning barely lasted a few months.","Great for a few months, but after that the cushion absolutely disappears. I sit in my chair for 6 hours or so a day, as most people who work in an office do. It was comfy at first, but now it's like I'm sitting on wood. My tailbone is sore now that I keep sitting on it. If you want to replace your chair after 3-4 months then this will work. I was hoping to get at least a year out of this. Don't buy for longevity.","24 Feb 2018","","","Yes","Steven Irvine","1.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Excellent chair.","This is a very nice chair for the price. I especially love the way they packaged the screws, etc. Very clearly labeled and a big improvement, in my opinion, over the usual blister packs. It's quite comfortable for a 6' tall 175lb guy. Adjustment is easy, rolls nicely, all the stuff you want in a chair. I saw some complaints on here about overlap of the metal plates between the chair back and main support plate. This was addressed in the instructions in my case. Not a problem. I design machines for a living and I don't think this is a major issue, didn't impede assembly and helps relieve stress on the bottom of the chair if anything, I saw some pictures of the o-ring around the mesh coming loose. Mine did too. A couple of drops of super glue cured that, the rubber ring is strictly decorative in my opinion anyway. Glue it in, you'll be fine. Great bang for the buck! Would buy again and recommend highly. Didn't take anything off my 5 star rating because any objections I may have had weren't worth making a very nice, cost effective product look even slightly bad over trivial BS.","13 Mar 2018","","","Yes","Scott Drager","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Do Not Buy!","I purchased one of these chairs back in August of 2017 and it has been amazing, but the seat has gotten a little worn so I just ordered a new one (September 2019). I was SO DISAPPOINTED when I got it all put together-- it looks the same, but it is a cheap version that is literally too uncomfortable to sit in. The metals posts that support the back are shorter, the back now needs to be screwed on (the old version is permanently connected); the edging that goes around the back has been removed (and is sharp); the mesh is rougher; and the wheels dont fit flush to the base, which cause a wobble ( see photos ). I would have packaged it all up to return already, except that adjustable shaft is now stuck in the base and the chair -- I've had to call in a favor to have a second person come and help me pull it apart tomorrow. It is so disappointing on every level possible, and I'll definitely think twice before purchasing another piece of Amazon Basics furniture.","30 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71laL+-yKpL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Small chair for small people","I read the reviews before buying and these people were right. The arms are weird and too short to be useful. They do not adjust. And I am a short and small person (5') so this chair is great for me but my 6'3 husband not so much, which is fine because I got it for me, it's MY chair, so he shouldn't be sitting in it anyway. I call that a win. I happen to think it's actually really comfortable especially considering how cheap it was. Looks nice enough and It was super easy to assemble. Seems pretty durable. I've spent entire days in this chair working and so far not one backache.","07 Apr 2017","","","Yes","tourdm","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Does not age well","I've owned it for a year so this review is based on long term results as the comfort has changed since I first put it together.  The cushion is now maybe 20% the thickness it once was, at least in the spots I most frequently sit.  I find myself rotating positions as my butt gets tired and back starts to ache. The armrests are hard plastic, would like to see some sort of softer material used instead. Back support is probably the highlight (despite my back feeling sore on occasion, I think that is due to awkward positions necessitated out of discomfort from below). The chair is available for a great price, but after a year I'm already starting to shop around.  My guess is you get what you pay for, and I plan on a significant upgrade.","27 Apr 2017","","","Yes","W.

I spent a LOT of time reading reviews and comparing various chairs. I finally decided to give this chair a chance and I'm very glad I did. It's a nice chair, not only for the price, but just in general. I wrote this review after receiving the chair, assembling it, and using it for a day. If anything changes, I'll update the review. But really... Maybe there are people for whom this chair wouldn't work. But it feels to me like a nice comfortable chair of average / compact dimensions that you might find in almost any office. One tip about the arms being too close together... The arms have slots in them for the bolts. So you can choose whether to snug the arms against the edges of the seat or allow a little extra width. I assembled the arms in the widest place in the slots. I recommend you do the same, no matter your size. It will give you some extra room in the chair. I'm picky. I'm not small. Price wasn't my #1 consideration in my decision. I like the chair and I'd buy it again.","22 Jul 2019","","","Yes","Eric Lovgren","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Cushioning barely lasted a few months.","Great for a few months, but after that the cushion absolutely disappears. I sit in my chair for 6 hours or so a day, as most people who work in an office do. It was comfy at first, but now it's like I'm sitting on wood. My tailbone is sore now that I keep sitting on it. If you want to replace your chair after 3-4 months then this will work. I was hoping to get at least a year out of this.

"Excellent chair.","This is a very nice chair for the price. I especially love the way they packaged the screws, etc. Very clearly labeled and a big improvement, in my opinion, over the usual blister packs. It's quite comfortable for a 6' tall 175lb guy. Adjustment is easy, rolls nicely, all the stuff you want in a chair. I saw some complaints on here about overlap of the metal plates between the chair back and main support plate. This was addressed in the instructions in my case. Not a problem. I design machines for a living and I don't think this is a major issue, didn't impede assembly and helps relieve stress on the bottom of the chair if anything, I saw some pictures of the o-ring around the mesh coming loose. Mine did too. A couple of drops of super glue cured that, the rubber ring is strictly decorative in my opinion anyway. Glue it in, you'll be fine. Great bang for the buck! Would buy again and recommend highly. Didn't take anything off my 5 star rating because any objections I may have had weren't worth making a very nice, cost effective product look even slightly bad over trivial BS.","13 Mar 2018","","","Yes","Scott Drager","5.0","AmazonBasics Mesh, Mid-Back, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrests, Black","/AmazonBasics-Mid-Back-Office-Chair-Armrests/product-reviews/B00IIFW2L4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good if you only need a chair for a month","The fabric/pleather on this chair has torn after a month of daily use.

"Unfortunate","Received chair and all of the parts for assembly are zippered into the back of it (unfortunately)- it makes little sense to do this. After unzipping the back I noticed one of the zippers teeth were missing and subsequently the zipper went off it’s track and came apart. I continued putting the chair together and figured I would try and deal with the zipper later. The chair itself was simple to assemble. However it took a lot of finagling to get the zipper back together and it will still require a dab of glue to keep its hold. If your wondering why I did not return the chair - it’s because it took weeks to get to me in the first place and I didn’t want to wait for the exchange as I needed an office chair. Had really hoped for a better experience.","05 Apr 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","Jen P","2.0","AmazonBasics Classic Puresoft PU-Padded Mid-Back Office Computer Desk Chair with Armrest - Black","/AmazonBasics-Puresoft-PU-Padded-Mid-Back-Computer/product-reviews/B081H3Y5NW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great Office Chair for the money","After reading all of the reviews I decided to purchase the AmazonBasics office chair. I like the fact that it is light weight to move yet very sturdy to sit in. It does start to feel hard after a few hours of sitting in it. The seat height adjustment is great to have and works well. I lower the seat to put on my shoes and raise it again while sitting at the computer. There were a few comments about the vinyl covering. It looks very nice and feels very soft. I don't know how long the covering will last. All-in-all the AmazonBasics office chair is a good value for the money. Be careful when installing the seat to armrest screws. They will strip on you and/or the threads will pull out the chair stuffing if you miss the hole while turning the screws in.","26 Mar 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","AzIronman","5.0","AmazonBasics Classic Puresoft PU-Padded Mid-Back Office Computer Desk Chair with Armrest - Black","/AmazonBasics-Puresoft-PU-Padded-Mid-Back-Computer/product-reviews/B081H3Y5NW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Finally, a chair that fits!","This chair is just perfect for me, and this is the THIRD chair I've purchased. Finally got it right. It has just enough support and height, AND I love that even with the arms down, as I'm typing they don't touch my arms. So when I'm in work mode, I'm free, and when I want to lean back and think about what I've composed, I can do so comfortably. It's also surprisingly light. It honestly feels like it was made on one of those 3D printer things. It was very easy to put together and I did it alone in about 18 minutes tops, including unpacking it. Bravo! Now...about the writer's block...😔 UPDATE JAN 16 I am in love with this chair. You don't know what you've missed until you've got it. The fact that I can raise the arms independently is EVERYTHING! I can throw a leg over one while I'm watching TV or writing, and then totally switch to a comfortable position while I'm doing my nails. And when it's chilly and you want to tuck a blanket around you, all you have to do is throw up the arms and pull it over you. That sounds like nothing but so many times I've grabbed a blanket or a throw and had to stand up to tuck it around me. It's a nice little luxury. I'm spoiled now. At the highest height, I don't even need it and sometimes just throw it on the couch. That's rare for me. And the lumbar support is fine. And the height is surprising, too. I have a cushion that I sit on. It raises me about 2.5 inches or so. Beside my couch this has become one of my favorite seats in my apartment.  Oh, and while it rolls freely, it doesn't OVER-roll. My last chair I had, I had to buy a stock set of non-rolling caps because I couldn't sit still in it. I wish I could lock the seat into place at an angle but at a later date I'll probably get one of those too. For now, this suits me just fine.","15 Jan 2020","Color: White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LdTDKUaTL._SY88.jpg","Yes","#EAHWP","5.0","Hbada Office Task Desk Chair Swivel Home Comfort Chairs with Flip-up Arms and Adjustable Height, White","/Hbada-Office-Comfort-Flip-up-Adjustable/product-reviews/B07QLR12BV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Well Made, Perfect  Compact Size, Good Features","This chair was purchased to replace an office chair being used at my kitchen desk.  I am very happy with the choice of Hbada for price, design and features.  It is adjustable and comfortable plus the size is perfect.  It is smaller than the previous chair, which is a bonus.  My old, large black task chair was too large and bulky for the space; the faux leather on the large arms of it severely cracked, as did the seat.  The arms on the Hbada chair are smaller and also may be raised and lowered.  On my old chair, the arms were large, extended further out and were fixed in place. These arms are constructed of a solid material, rather than upholstered (which will quickly tear & crack); The seat on the Hbada chair is a comfortable, cool and breathable woven upholstery, which can be treated with a stain repellent if necessary.  It also rolls easily across a rug I use, So glad I went with this Hbada chair.  The compact design and adjustable features, including the arms, were for me, a great choice.  It's a good value.

"Sturdy Office Chair with Sleek Design","Since I work from home often, I have been looking to buy an office chair.

It also has good workmanship, sturdy and stable. The chair swivel freely and around, and its height can be adjusted easily to very low or very high level. The mesh back feels springy and comfortable. The cushioned seat is firm and comfortable to sit on. After using the chair for a few days, it dispels my concerns one reviewer raised about the seat cushion collapsing after a few sittings. For me with normal weight, the seat feels just right. I noticed the seller does not mention about the cushion in the description.

"Stylish, Great for a Small Space","I was attracted to the small size because I planned to use it for my home office in my bedroom.  The seat is plenty roomy for me to sit ""regularly"" or with one leg tucked under my butt.  I'm 5'-2"" tall and 135 lbs, so that will give you an idea of the scale.  The armrests go up so the chair slides underneath the desk, which is different than the other chairs I considered.  Height is easily adjusted.  Lumbar support is nominal, so I got a small lumbar pillow at a thrift store for $3.99 and now it's perfect! Great price and VERY easy to put together.  I got it in white and it came with white gloves for assembly.  :-)  Highly recommend.","11 Jan 2020","Color: White","","Yes","Aisha","5.0","Hbada Office Task Desk Chair Swivel Home Comfort Chairs with Flip-up Arms and Adjustable Height, White","/Hbada-Office-Comfort-Flip-up-Adjustable/product-reviews/B07QLR12BV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great Chair","Easy to assemble and good quality. Well worth a few extra bucks, especially for daily use. Really comfortable seat, great contoured back, and adjustable in every way you could ever want, which is what we were looking for. After purchasing leather/bonded leather chairs and having them peel, we have decided this might be the perfect compromise. I'm still figuring out just how loose I want to make the tilt adjustment. I put it together myself accordding with assemble instructions, but it would be way faster and less awkward with help. I'v had it for 2 weeks and so far i still like it.","29 Jul 2019","Color: White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+U6p9bTyL._SY88.jpg","Yes","HL","5.0","Hbada Office Task Desk Chair Swivel Home Comfort Chairs with Flip-up Arms and Adjustable Height, White","/Hbada-Office-Comfort-Flip-up-Adjustable/product-reviews/B07QLR12BV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Finally, a chair that fits!","This chair is just perfect for me, and this is the THIRD chair I've purchased. Finally got it right. It has just enough support and height, AND I love that even with the arms down, as I'm typing they don't touch my arms. So when I'm in work mode, I'm free, and when I want to lean back and think about what I've composed, I can do so comfortably. It's also surprisingly light. It honestly feels like it was made on one of those 3D printer things. It was very easy to put together and I did it alone in about 18 minutes tops, including unpacking it. Bravo! Now...about the writer's block...😔 UPDATE JAN 16 I am in love with this chair. You don't know what you've missed until you've got it. The fact that I can raise the arms independently is EVERYTHING! I can throw a leg over one while I'm watching TV or writing, and then totally switch to a comfortable position while I'm doing my nails. And when it's chilly and you want to tuck a blanket around you, all you have to do is throw up the arms and pull it over you. That sounds like nothing but so many times I've grabbed a blanket or a throw and had to stand up to tuck it around me. It's a nice little luxury. I'm spoiled now. At the highest height, I don't even need it and sometimes just throw it on the couch. That's rare for me. And the lumbar support is fine. And the height is surprising, too. I have a cushion that I sit on. It raises me about 2.5 inches or so. Beside my couch this has become one of my favorite seats in my apartment.  Oh, and while it rolls freely, it doesn't OVER-roll. My last chair I had, I had to buy a stock set of non-rolling caps because I couldn't sit still in it. I wish I could lock the seat into place at an angle but at a later date I'll probably get one of those too. For now, this suits me just fine.","15 Jan 2020","Color: White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LdTDKUaTL._SY88.jpg","Yes","#EAHWP","5.0","Hbada Office Task Desk Chair Swivel Home Comfort Chairs with Flip-up Arms and Adjustable Height, White","/Hbada-Office-Comfort-Flip-up-Adjustable/product-reviews/B07QLR12BV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Can reverse a hunchback","The mesh back office chair is more comfortable and durable than the office chair made of leather. Its backrest conforms to the ergonomics can reverse a hunchback. Its mesh backrest design is cool and breathable suitable for summer to use. The flip-up arms that surprise me can be hidden entirely vertically, and I like to do this when watching movies. Its components are relatively simple to install, and it is easy for girls to assemble it. I only spent about 20 minutes to complete, proud:) I think the only disadvantage is that the seat cushion is smaller. If the seat cushion can be a larger size, it can be more comfortable and suitable for people with different body types.","07 Jun 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Bs6RshDaL._SY88.jpg

"Well Made, Perfect  Compact Size, Good Features","This chair was purchased to replace an office chair being used at my kitchen desk.  I am very happy with the choice of Hbada for price, design and features.  It is adjustable and comfortable plus the size is perfect.  It is smaller than the previous chair, which is a bonus.  My old, large black task chair was too large and bulky for the space; the faux leather on the large arms of it severely cracked, as did the seat.  The arms on the Hbada chair are smaller and also may be raised and lowered.  On my old chair, the arms were large, extended further out and were fixed in place. These arms are constructed of a solid material, rather than upholstered (which will quickly tear & crack); The seat on the Hbada chair is a comfortable, cool and breathable woven upholstery, which can be treated with a stain repellent if necessary.  It also rolls easily across a rug I use, So glad I went with this Hbada chair.  The compact design and adjustable features, including the arms, were for me, a great choice.  It's a good value. Comparable chairs are more bulky and up to twice as expensive.","27 Jan 2020","Color: White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71t7AFfiQ9L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Goldenmom","5.0","Hbada Office Task Desk Chair Swivel Home Comfort Chairs with Flip-up Arms and Adjustable Height, White","/Hbada-Office-Comfort-Flip-up-Adjustable/product-reviews/B07QLR12BV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Sturdy Office Chair with Sleek Design","Since I work from home often, I have been looking to buy an office chair. The slick design of the chair caught my eye since I did not like a bulky one for limited space of my corner office. Now I have had the chair for a few days, and it does not disappoint me. First, the chair is pretty easy to assemble. Took me only 20 minutes, and all screws are provided with a few extra. The chair has sleek design, look simple and elegant. It also has good workmanship, sturdy and stable. The chair swivel freely and around, and its height can be adjusted easily to very low or very high level. The mesh back feels springy and comfortable. The cushioned seat is firm and comfortable to sit on. After using the chair for a few days, it dispels my concerns one reviewer raised about the seat cushion collapsing after a few sittings. For me with normal weight, the seat feels just right. I noticed the seller does not mention about the cushion in the description. I suggest the seller should provide some information for prospective buyers.","14 Dec 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Qc+JIX-SL._SY88.jpg

"The more you sit, the more you will like.","About the Product It is a nice little tall chair with head rest and lumbar support. It is pretty light weight compared to the looks and size. Most of the Weight is on the lower half of the chair. IT rotates, moves up and down and rocks. IT would be good in winter if you want to hang anything back Who Should buy this This is probably for people who spends a long time sitting in the chair with constant moving front and back. People Who works from a desk primarily. It would also be beneficial to Students who spend quite a bit of time in the chair for gaming, writing studying. Things Great about This product Lumbar support would be the standout feature in this chair.Elbow rest are smooth. It's a little feature but nice one when you spend a lot of time in the chair. Back and forth motion Is great only after loosening it. Assembly is easy and you can move it easily from one place to another. Things not so great about this product Base cushion is not a lot compared to the other chairs I have sat. once you sit, you get used to it so you wont think about it. Color is grey. It does not goes well with lot of room colors. Would have been great if it came in black. My Recommendation If you are a person who expects the features and the looks, you can buy this product.Also consider this only if you are going to spend a lot of time in the chair. The more you sit, the more you will like.","09 Jan 2020","Color: Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714Ciivzq6L._SY88.jpg

"Comfy and cool","A wonderfully comfortable chair, that assembled quickly and easily. I did opt to upgrade the wheels, and am glad I did. The swapped out ones look awesome and roll better. Not so much on carpet, but are great on hard floors like tile, wood, or linoleum, but very few do. The chair is really comfortable, and rocks great. Very stylish too, and will certainly make the office/gaming den look awesome. Also, loving the mesh.... it keeps my back chill on those game benders.","11 Dec 2019","Color: Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716LlmMmtVL._SY88.jpg

"The more you sit, the more you will like.","About the Product It is a nice little tall chair with head rest and lumbar support. It is pretty light weight compared to the looks and size. Most of the Weight is on the lower half of the chair. IT rotates, moves up and down and rocks. IT would be good in winter if you want to hang anything back Who Should buy this This is probably for people who spends a long time sitting in the chair with constant moving front and back. People Who works from a desk primarily. It would also be beneficial to Students who spend quite a bit of time in the chair for gaming, writing studying. Things Great about This product Lumbar support would be the standout feature in this chair.Elbow rest are smooth. It's a little feature but nice one when you spend a lot of time in the chair. Back and forth motion Is great only after loosening it. Assembly is easy and you can move it easily from one place to another. Things not so great about this product Base cushion is not a lot compared to the other chairs I have sat. once you sit, you get used to it so you wont think about it. Color is grey. It does not goes well with lot of room colors. Would have been great if it came in black. My Recommendation If you are a person who expects the features and the looks, you can buy this product.Also consider this only if you are going to spend a lot of time in the chair. The more you sit, the more you will like.","09 Jan 2020","Color: Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714Ciivzq6L._SY88.jpg

"Another great deal for the money.","I'll admit that when I bought this chair I didn't even pay attention to the fact that it said ""AmazonBasics"" in the title.  But as it turns out, Amazing must have contracted some Chinese company to build them stuff in their name.  And as such, you can bet that the quailty of the item will actually be rather good.  Why would Amazon put their name on garbage? This chair is a fantastic value.  It was easy to put together, came with an Allen key and all if the hardware was in small, separate baggies that were labeled and the instructions were very well written and very easy to understand.  I had the chair together in under ten minutes while moving at a leisurely pace.  On top of this, the bolts came with blue thread locker already on them.  I know that isn't a huge deal to most people, but it means something to me.  It shows they want you to have this thing in one piece for a long time. The chair looks and feels like something you'd have in a professional office.  The faux leather is well made and quite comfortable.  The adjustment on it works very well and over all, the chair feels like it should cost much closer to the $100 mark. Make no mistake, this isnt some $300 chair, but at the same time, it isn't trying to be.  I basically bought this thing to sit in front of our computer that we almost never use.  So, in reality, I almost bought it just to complete my office.  So, if you have a home office and want a chair that's very comfortable, looks good but don't care about the lack of head rest and don't want to break the bank, this is the one. I actually work in front of a computer all day long, and this is a chair I wouldn't mind having there.  I'd probably miss the head rest after a bit, but this is something I would use in a professional setting.","15 Jan 2018","Color: Black","","Yes","Grayson Gilman","5.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great For Occasional Home Office Use, Not For Full Timers...","I don't see many reviews regarding using this chair as a full time work chair.

Invest some money in your employees chairs, they will be much more willing to work for you.  This chair is not meant for someone who spends a significant amount of time in it.  It has been a week and both armrests broke.  The chair has leaned to one side sine I got it and the seat back has never been able to be locked into an upright position.

"Chair arm broke after a week. You pay for what you get with AmazonBasics","Got this chair for my new apartment, and it was great for one week until the arm broke. I'm not a big person, 5'8""/130, so I was surprised when the arm just snapped when I pushed on it getting up out of the seat. I read the other comments about the padding and height, but since I'm on the lighter side I figured I could make it work. The back is short, and the padding is a bit thin, but both are relatively good at this price point. If not for this defect it would be a solid chair at a reasonable price. I don't seem to be the only one with the arm-break issue, just be aware of the realities of cheaper products. Also, it's annoying that the only options for full refund or replacement require you to send the item back - a desk chair isn't exactly the easiest thing to ship back. Update: Called Amazon, was able to get a partial refund and keep the broken chair, but was surprised that I couldn't just get a replacement part for the broken arm. I sort of assumed that since it was their brand (AmazonBasics) that they'd have an army of these things and their corresponding parts for replacements, but that's apparently not an option. Silver lining is that luckily mine broke within a week so I was still able to get Amazon's help with the partial refund, but next time I shop on Amazon I think I'll be avoiding anything branded AmazonBasics.","19 Jul 2015","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XYbJME0yL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Calvin","2.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"DO NOT BUY. Extremely uncomfortable. Rigid, sharp edge just under padding, presses into spine around mid-lower back.","Possibly the least comfortable chair I've ever owned. There's what feels like a sharp, rigid edge, just underneath the upper padding (picture the edge of a piece of plywood) running across the back, roughly at the level of the seam in the middle of the back. The padding is completely inadequate and does not even cover the structural material of the chair. Sitting in this thing for an hour means back pain. After two weeks of using this chair, my back HURTS. For what it's worth, I'm not a big person. I'm 5'10 and 140 pounds. I don't usually have problems finding reasonably comfortable, supportive chairs. If you are large, or if you have a specific medical need for an ergonomic chair with back support... Or, if you're breathing. If you can read this, you need to avoid the AmazonBasics Mid-Back Office Chair.","10 Aug 2017","Color: Black","","Yes","Amazon Customer","1.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good looking chair, but weak armrest (read updates)","I cannot recommend the chair to daily users. Barely 2 days after assembling the chair, I managed to crack the right side armrest as I was shifting my weight to correct my posture; I barely weigh 155lbs and the armrest didn't even bear my full weight before buckling. It's such a shame. The chair looks decent, feels good, and was easy to assemble; it's just that the armrests are terribly brittle. Currently in the process of getting a replacement armrest sent out by Amazon (hopefully). Will update my review with how that goes. (Update) Amazon offered a 35% refund, a refund the cost of the replacement part, a free replacement, or a full refund. I decided to go with a free replacement. (Updated 2) It's now late June 2017 and the replacement chair is still going strong. I suspect the original run of these had weak/defective arm rests that have since been corrected. Overall the chair looks immaculate except for a few minor cosmetic defects: first the vinyl on my left arm rest has begun to fray, a problem that continued use will exacerbate until I patch it. Second, the screw hole plugs repeatedly fall out, they're simply too loose to fit snugly into their holes. Other than that, it's proven to be durable and looks new at a glance, so I'll bump this up to a 3-star product (original 2-star) as its proven to be durable.","31 Jul 2015","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EzXiuGDtL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Spartan VI","3.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Will last LESS than 6 Months. DO NOT BUY!!!","I bought this chair in April for my desk at home where I work remotely. I was really happy with the comfort & ease of construction for the first three weeks but that's when signs of wear and tear started. 1 month into buying this chair, the pleather started to rip off the seat cushion. At 5 months (as seen in pics), you can see how worn the front of the cushion is and how it's about to fall off. (This is WITH bi-weekly wipe downs too to make sure the white is still clean) I was OK with using this chair with a ripped cushion... that is until this last week where the bolts holding the back on have stopped holding. The screws/bolts are wayyy too short for this chair to be stable for a long period of time, they're less than an inch long and are barely long enough to reach through the frame to the cushion. In fact, I can't even get the bolts back in due to the chair back warping to my back. PROS: -was handy for a month? -elbow cushions are nice CONS: -wears extremely fast -will break within the first couple months -seat cushion rips & flattens within the first month -pretty sure it's not stable for bigger people, I'm 150 lbs and the back frame started to warp under my pressure. All in all, this chair would have been worth it with if it would've lasted at LEAST a year!! Instead, at 5-6 months-- this chair is a terrible choice & a waste of money since it will be going into the trash today. 10/10 do not recommend getting this chair unless you're only going to use it for decor.","30 Sep 2019","Color: White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41cQHKv4hSL._SY88.jpg

Silver lining is that luckily mine broke within a week so I was still able to get Amazon's help with the partial refund, but next time I shop on Amazon I think I'll be avoiding anything branded AmazonBasics.","19 Jul 2015","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XYbJME0yL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Calvin","2.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"DO NOT BUY. Extremely uncomfortable. Rigid, sharp edge just under padding, presses into spine around mid-lower back.","Possibly the least comfortable chair I've ever owned. There's what feels like a sharp, rigid edge, just underneath the upper padding (picture the edge of a piece of plywood) running across the back, roughly at the level of the seam in the middle of the back. The padding is completely inadequate and does not even cover the structural material of the chair. Sitting in this thing for an hour means back pain. After two weeks of using this chair, my back HURTS. For what it's worth, I'm not a big person. I'm 5'10 and 140 pounds. I don't usually have problems finding reasonably comfortable, supportive chairs. If you are large, or if you have a specific medical need for an ergonomic chair with back support... Or, if you're breathing. If you can read this, you need to avoid the AmazonBasics Mid-Back Office Chair.","10 Aug 2017","Color: Black","","Yes","Amazon Customer","1.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good looking chair, but weak armrest (read updates)","I cannot recommend the chair to daily users. Barely 2 days after assembling the chair, I managed to crack the right side armrest as I was shifting my weight to correct my posture; I barely weigh 155lbs and the armrest didn't even bear my full weight before buckling. It's such a shame. The chair looks decent, feels good, and was easy to assemble; it's just that the armrests are terribly brittle. Currently in the process of getting a replacement armrest sent out by Amazon (hopefully). Will update my review with how that goes. (Update) Amazon offered a 35% refund, a refund the cost of the replacement part, a free replacement, or a full refund. I decided to go with a free replacement. (Updated 2) It's now late June 2017 and the replacement chair is still going strong. I suspect the original run of these had weak/defective arm rests that have since been corrected. Overall the chair looks immaculate except for a few minor cosmetic defects: first the vinyl on my left arm rest has begun to fray, a problem that continued use will exacerbate until I patch it. Second, the screw hole plugs repeatedly fall out, they're simply too loose to fit snugly into their holes. Other than that, it's proven to be durable and looks new at a glance, so I'll bump this up to a 3-star product (original 2-star) as its proven to be durable.","31 Jul 2015","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EzXiuGDtL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Spartan VI","3.0","AmazonBasics Leather-Padded, Adjustable, Swivel Office Desk Chair with Armrest, Black","/AmazonBasics-Classic-Leather-Padded-Mid-Back-Armrest/product-reviews/B00IFHPVEU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Will last LESS than 6 Months. DO NOT BUY!!!","I bought this chair in April for my desk at home where I work remotely. I was really happy with the comfort & ease of construction for the first three weeks but that's when signs of wear and tear started. 1 month into buying this chair, the pleather started to rip off the seat cushion. At 5 months (as seen in pics), you can see how worn the front of the cushion is and how it's about to fall off. (This is WITH bi-weekly wipe downs too to make sure the white is still clean) I was OK with using this chair with a ripped cushion... that is until this last week where the bolts holding the back on have stopped holding. The screws/bolts are wayyy too short for this chair to be stable for a long period of time, they're less than an inch long and are barely long enough to reach through the frame to the cushion. In fact, I can't even get the bolts back in due to the chair back warping to my back. PROS: -was handy for a month? -elbow cushions are nice CONS: -wears extremely fast -will break within the first couple months -seat cushion rips & flattens within the first month -pretty sure it's not stable for bigger people, I'm 150 lbs and the back frame started to warp under my pressure. All in all, this chair would have been worth it with if it would've lasted at LEAST a year!! Instead, at 5-6 months-- this chair is a terrible choice & a waste of money since it will be going into the trash today. 10/10 do not recommend getting this chair unless you're only going to use it for decor.","30 Sep 2019","Color: White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41cQHKv4hSL._SY88.jpg

"Beautiful Chair for Great Price","Wife wanted comfortable/movable chair with firm cushion and straight back for post surgery recovery.  She is 5-1, 125lbs.  At low seat height and the back up straight with no backward lean she finds this chair will be ideal for her several months of recovery.  No need for a high back model.  Our other chairs and sofa are too soft and lean back.  This chair can lean back if desired with a quick pull out of the control lever.  The padded arms are very nice and soft.

I purchased this initially based on review and price point and I was not disappointed! It is extremely comfy and I can easily sit through an 8 hour work day with no issues or discomfort. I tend to sit a little off sided and sometimes criss cross, so i like that this chair has a wide bottom. The installation didn't take long at all and I was able to complete myself in about 15 mins. The side arms and back adjusts which is super convenient.

"Great office chair","I have been using this chair every day for almost 2 weeks now, so far no complains yet.  The installation was fairly easy. It took about 20 minutes. I do like the ergonomics factors of the chair, it supports my back well. The chair I replaced was big and bulky and my upper back used to hurt after sitting on it for 9 hours. Like most, I am also working from home these days and long continuous sitting in-home office chair has been hurting my back. I wanted to get a new chair and tried this one. The armrest is pretty good and the mesh is strong to hold my back. Head support would have been great and the messaging cushion is useless. Overall it is a sturdy chair with a form- factor that does not really overly bulky. I'll update the review if something changes in the future.","14 Sep 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Y3E9ylr-L._SY88.jpg

"Cheaper than Herman Miller, almost as nice.  Larger seat than cheaper models.","I got spoiled by a Herman Miller chair at work.  I've been putting up with some cheapo cloth and foam computer desk chair for years.  Now that I'm a bit older, and do some work at home, I needed more comfort and support, this chair works for what I need and it didn't cost me $800.  Granted this one isn't as adjustable, and the lumbar support isn't pronounced, but it is soooo much better than what I had.  It might be difficult for some to put together, as it can a bit heavy for one person, but the weight also contributes to the ""well-made"" feeling once put together.  The best thing about this chair is the size of the seat, which full supports my butt, and back of my thighs, all the way to the back of my knees.  The neck support is nice too, but I could see some being irritated with the limited positioning... It can be removed.","13 Feb 2020","Color: Black-01","","Yes","Christopher L.

"Great for the price with a few drawbacks","I struggle with back and neck pain and I needed a good hair at an affordable price. This chair does exactly that but with a couple frustrating things about it. 1. The seat is in a locked position and does not slide so you are almost forced to sit further down in the chair due to the plastic bezel around the seat mesh that will hurt quickly. I prefer to snug the chair for full back support but I have to slip down into the chair with my lower back not being supported. Not the end of the world but you'd think there would be at least a few inches of play but no there is just a large empty hole that you have to fill. 2. The neck support feels GREAT! But.. I am 6 foot 180 lbs and it just barely isnt tall enough for my neck to sit comfortably unless I'm leaned back while pushing myself further into the chair. 3. Arm rests are adjustable in terms of height and they fold back well. My 28 inch desk does not fit these chair arms in any position so I'm forced to put them up. My solution to this is to purchase a new desk that'll sit roughly 32inches off the ground. Good thing I already have plans for a DIY Ikea desk anyways. 4. The tilt function is just weird. You can lock it into position but only on certain parts of tilt. Even on the max setting (knob underneath seat) if I just put a little bit of weight on the back of the chair I go flying back into a recline position. 5. Support - there's plenty of it. I had a $150 gaming chair before this one and it blows it out of the water. So darn comfortable when you find that sweet spot of how to sit in it. The mesh feels great and gives plenty of support to my entire body. 6. Assembly took me 3 minutes to get the chair together. Super straight forward, if you have any sense the manual isnt even necessary. I don't know if I'm going to return it or not. I really do like this chair but it does have a lot of downsides. Maybe because of the price point but I feel like for $350 with tax it should not be missing these crucial adjustments and functionalities.","10 May 2020","Color: Black-01","","Yes","Tyler Geringer","4.0","Gabrylly Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair, High Back Desk Chair - Adjustable Headrest with Flip-Up Arms, Tilt Function, Lumbar Support and PU Wheels, Swivel Computer Task Chair","/Gabrylly-Ergonomic-Mesh-Office-Chair/product-reviews/B07Y8BXBX8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

I'm 6' 2"" with a thick build. I was excited about it being rated for 280 pounds, and the chair does indeed seem solidly built. That said, it's made for small people. The headrest, at full extension, presses against my upper shoulders. It'd need to be another 6"" taller to be useful for someone my height.

"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING! AND MY BUTT IS VERY HAPPY AND THANKFUL! THANK YOU!","First off... let me start off by telling you how long i sit in a chair. I usually sit for minimum about 12 hours a day.  It is how i start the day and how i end my day. I make music throughout the day and usually im front of the computer for extended amounts of time. For anyone that sits for long amounts of time, they would know that it comes with aches and pains in odd places (usually back and buttox).  Because of this, i always have been in the market for new chairs.  Most chairs are great but its different when you sit for an extended amount of time.  This is where a great chair really shines.  If you can sit in the chair for longer, you can get more work done with taking less breaks, and at the end of the day you can relax without any pain radiating from your back or pelvic region.  This chair does that! Not to mention, the ease of building the chair was really nice! I was thinking that it was going to take a while to piece it together however i did it in less than 15 minutes following their manual they provided.  Super Simple! All in all, I would recommend this chair to anyone and everyone! its cheap compared to other chairs on the market and especially for the people that sits for extended amounts of time i really suggest purchasing this chair because it is a GAME CHANGER! PS.. my dog hopped up on the chair while i was taking pictures. This chair is officially ""Mugsy Approved"".","24 May 2019","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S9qQ1d6xL._SY88.jpg

"how much I love this Ergonomic Office Chair.","This ergonomic office chair has been uniquely designed to imply the biomorphic principles of the body. It helps in the genuine reduction of the lower back pain. Also, the headrest that is provided has the power to be moved so that you can align your neck in different positions. It has a mesh back that helps in the proper passage of hair, thereby making you remain cool throughout your work. The armrest has been designed in a 3D style that also features some of the best height and width adjustability. Therefore, it accommodates all types of sizes and shapes, therefore can be also used as a comfy office chair for affordable price. Also according to your working desk, the height of the chair can be adjusted and re-adjusted(see attached video). Additionally, it offers a free set of silky smooth roller blade wheels on top of hardwood.","02 May 2019","Color: Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R6-gbSvDL._SY88.jpg

"Comfortable and Affordable Ergonomic Office Chair","Super fast delivery, easy assembly and great price point. My office is looking into purchasing several new desk chairs and we happened across the NOUHAUS Ergo3D rolling desk chair. Look no further! We purchased the Gray model and are very pleased with the look and comfort of our new chair. I was able to assemble it alone in about 20 minutes with no problems, so am glad we didn't pay the extra money for ""expert"" assembly. We've been testing it out all day, and have determined that whether your 5'3"" (me) or 6'2"" (co-worker), the chair is comfortable and a great value.","16 Apr 2019","Color: Grey","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8107qt6Mu6L._SY88.jpg

"So far so good!","I've only had the product for a few days, but I like what I'm experiencing so far.  The chair was delivered when promised.  It was not difficult to assemble.  The roller blade wheels are very smooth.  It is comfortable.  The head rest is only functional when leaning back so unfortunately does not come into play why working at my desk.  The arm rests move a little too easily for my taste.  However...none of these small gripes are negative enough for me to deduct a star at this point. I was a little concerned about support at the start.  I wanted to register the product for the warranty but their website was non-functional, no one picked up when I called or returned my call.  Someone did get back to me thru Facebook and took care of the warranty for me.  They also informed me that their website is under construction.  So all's good here.","22 Jul 2019","Color: Grey","","Yes","jrc","5.0","NOUHAUS Ergo3D Ergonomic Office Chair - Rolling Desk Chair with 3D Adjustable Armrest, 3D Lumbar Support and Extra Blade Wheels - Mesh Computer Chair, Gaming Chairs, Executive Swivel Chair (Grey)","/NOUHAUS-Ergo3D-Ergonomic-Office-Chair/product-reviews/B07L4ZH59Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Best office chair ever!","This is by far the best office chair I have ever used!  I sit at my desk for 12 to 15 hours per day.  With all the other chairs I have tried ( and I have tried many ) I would constantly have issues with pain in my lower back.  I would also have recurring carpel tunnel issues due to the lack of adjustments with the armrests.  I no longer have these issues thanks to this chair!!  This chair is FAR AND AWAY the best chair I have ever used!  With the multiple adjustments for the armrests my carpel tunnel is gone!  The lumbar support has made my lower back issues disappear!! It arrived on time and was easy to assemble.  The chair also looks fantastic!  The chair is superior quality and the mesh material is great for breathability - which comes in handy when sitting in the chair for long periods of time!  I will be replacing all the chairs in my office with this fantastic chair!

"Cheap mesh, lumbar support is a joke.","The bad: The mesh is saggy and not nearly firm enough, the lumbar support is not NEARLY as supportive as the pictures make it seem, I don't like how it bends with my body weight pressed against it. Lumbar support is supposed to be firm, not squishy. Some hard parts at the edges of the mesh that cause minor discomfort, I had to put a quilt over the seat to prevent annoyance. Headrest doesn't lock at angles, only height. The good: Wheels are nice (but you can get those for any chair), headrest is a nice touch but needs more adjustments that lock in place. Arms are solidly built, I can hold my entire weight against them (I'm 170lbs). Sturdy construction minus the mesh itself. I'm returning this. This chair is not worth NEARLY 250 dollars, not even close. I doubt I'll even try mesh again (especially for the seat). Don't waste your time or money, find something better.","10 Jul 2019","Color: Grey","","Yes","jordan rattet","2.0","NOUHAUS Ergo3D Ergonomic Office Chair - Rolling Desk Chair with 3D Adjustable Armrest, 3D Lumbar Support and Extra Blade Wheels - Mesh Computer Chair, Gaming Chairs, Executive Swivel Chair (Grey)","/NOUHAUS-Ergo3D-Ergonomic-Office-Chair/product-reviews/B07L4ZH59Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great chair average builds.","This is the fifth chair I have purchased for office personnel within a year. Two of those chairs were executive style, two were gaming style and this office style. I purchased this chair for a 175lb person with an 8 hour desk job.  We had concerns moving worker into such a smaller type chair from an executive high back style. A month later the chair sitter came and thanked me and explained the chair was comfortable.  He stated the seat had more cushion and the back support had him sitting in a better posture. He said the arms were better placed then the last chair, not only making it more comfortable on the arms when used, but easier with the furniture around the desk space. I had never thought of that concern.  He smiled big when he said the breathable back fabric was perfect and he didn’t overheat. That was from the user himself. As the buyer - I found it straightforward to put together.  Lightweight and easy to maneuver. The chair style looks clean and modern. Chair feels solid and well made. The size is perfect for the spaces we have. Large enough to use properly, but not overly bulky. The back doesn’t stick out into the isle ways like the last set of chairs tended to. Package and delivery was fine. It is clever how they can package and ship office chairs today. Happy with this purchase and may purchase a few more for other office spaces.","16 Mar 2020","","","Yes","Doni","5.0","ZLHECTO Ergonomic Office Chair, Mid Back Desk Chairs with Flip Up Armrests and Lumbar Support,Weight Hold Up to 250Ibs - Adjustable Height Mesh Computer Chair for Conference Room","/ZLHECTO-Ergonomic-Office-Armrests-Support/product-reviews/B0848MNXRG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great for the price","I bought this as a general home office chair (not full-time use).  This chair exceeded my expectations.  It is comfortable and the adjustments are smooth and useful.  Unfortunately the instructions are minimalistic.  The handle/backrest combo was a little difficult for one person to assemble.  I thought it would be impossible but I put it together by myself by rotating/laying parts strategically so I could anchor one screw and then rotate the part to normal position to put in the second screw.  If you can't do it this way you will need a partner to help you hold things.  Regarding usage, it took me a while to figure out the recline/rocker feature.  I bought two chairs and one reclined but the other didn't, despite what we did with the tension knob.  The trick is in the lever that raises and lowers the chair.  Up/Down lowers the chair, but you can also slide it left/right to lock or unlock the tilt/recline/rocker mode.  Once I figured that out I have no complaints.  I can't speak to durability as I just got it, but the parts seem solid and well-built, so for the price I recommend this chair.","15 Jul 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","Porkins","5.0","Furmax High Back Office Chair Adjustable Ergonomic Desk Chair with Padded Armrests,Executive PU Leather Swivel Task Chair with Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Executive-Armrests-Adjustable-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07P8DMF9V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Not great, but good.","Assembly was frustrating on my own but once I got my power screw driver and a support box things went pretty smooth. On your own with just what they give you can be nightmare despite its simplicity. Out side of that I was very happy. Back support is terrific and overall very comfortable compared to some $200-$300 “gaming” chairs I have had. The big question will be longevity which at this price point isn’t usually that high but I have read good things in the comments with the biggest issues being merely cosmetic. If your looking for a simple, comfy, and cheap chair than I would recommend you grab one of these. Perhaps get the extended warranty for a few bucks more if your worried. Update: As of 8/15/2020 the chair has held up well. None of the cosmetic issues others have had but the arm rest padding has 'deflated' permanently. Not sure if that is the right word for the memory foam material but, no big deal. Still comfortable, good lumbar support, and if I have to spend $20 for arm rest padding then that beats a whole new chair.","26 May 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","joshua","5.0","Furmax High Back Office Chair Adjustable Ergonomic Desk Chair with Padded Armrests,Executive PU Leather Swivel Task Chair with Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Executive-Armrests-Adjustable-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07P8DMF9V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Nice chair, good value, easy assembly","This is replacing my former chair I've had for 15+ years that had most of the seams duct taped. So really nice to have something new. Very easy to put together. A couple hints: I would bolt the arms on (loosely!) to the seat when you bolt the seat bracket on the bottom  - BEFORE putting the seat on the base. Lay the seat on it's side and it will help hold/balance the arms as you put them on (if doing your self as I was). Then, with both arms attached but NOT TIGHT, lay the seat on it's side again to attach the back. I found it helped to attach the TOP seat back bolt first to hold it in place, then get the bottom one. Again, keep all the seat bottom & back bolts a little loose until you have them all started, then tighten them down. As far as comfort, not having ripped/split/taped seams poking into your legs is certainly an improvement!! (DUH!).  SO far, and I've only been sitting in it about 20 minutes, feels very nice. There IS a bit of a noticeable 'gap' or 'hump' between the back half of the seat cushion and the front half. Prior chair, the seat cushion was more a seamless '1 piece', so just a little to get used to but I think it will be fine. For the price ($100), I'm very happy.","23 Jun 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","Sheryl Meuchel","5.0","Furmax High Back Office Chair Adjustable Ergonomic Desk Chair with Padded Armrests,Executive PU Leather Swivel Task Chair with Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Executive-Armrests-Adjustable-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07P8DMF9V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"great chairs one damaged but fixed","I've updated this review from 4 to 5 stars.. customer service was EXCELLENT ! Updated review: they took care of the damaged arm in under 2 days, and have a replacement arm on it's way to me. I can't say enough how happy that makes me. I have to give the chairs 5 stars, and would give customer service 10 stars if I could. I can say I'd highly recommend this seller and this chair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original review: I bought 2 of these, they are really nice chairs.. they look nice and are very comfy, very nice for the price. easy to assemble but I'd recommend 2 people to help hold the pieces as you put them together. however I found the arm of one chair had been damaged in shipping. naturally I had one chair put together and the one with damage about 80% done before noticing.. so I've contacted the company to see if they can send me another ""arm"" for the chair. I'd have to say it doesn't' appear to be a manufacturing problem, and sending it back after we put it together and threw the boxes away, is likely out of the question.  We figure we were out of luck , but thought I'd reach out to the manufacture anyway. I'm hoping for a good result. I can tape it, but it's always disappointing to get something new and it's damaged. new rule at our house.. INSPECT.. INSPECT.. before you get rid of the boxes and assemble any items in the future. so overall, since the damage looks like a shipping problem I'd still recommend this chair, our other one arrived perfectly. the 4 stars is only for the shipping damage. otherwise it would be 5 stars. I may update to 5 stars if the manufacture can send me a replacement arm piece (customer service did in fact send me a replacement) now 5 stars all around !","24 Sep 2019","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715ROQLSrQL._SY88.jpg

"It came early and feels solid --initially.","Was delivered a full week before promised, everything was securely packaged, and the chair went together easily.  I am impressed with the look and feel of this chair and my 300 pound body feels well supported with no complaint about the width.  I will try to write another review in a year for durability, mainly because the main ""working part"" --the bracket under the seat that fits over the support stem-- looks suspiciously identical to the same part on a somewhat cheaper chair this one replaced.  That other one broke after 2-1/2 years and the height could not be adjusted while I felt that I was uncomfortably balanced on the end of a stick.  So far, after one day(!), this one feels great;  we'll see!","02 Jul 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","JOHNB","5.0","Furmax High Back Office Chair Adjustable Ergonomic Desk Chair with Padded Armrests,Executive PU Leather Swivel Task Chair with Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Executive-Armrests-Adjustable-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07P8DMF9V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Super comfortable chair that offers excellent support! A pain to assemble.","First - I love this chair. It may be the most comfortable office chair I've ever owned. It looks nice, smells nice, and I find it to be more comfortable that my Herman Miller chair I use at the office. That being said, the assembly was really painful. The instructions were unclear, and some steps were skipped over outright (the wheels for example - you have to really use some force to push them into the holes ALL THE WAY, otherwise when you sit they will fly off the chair and spin out in every direction. There were no instructions on how to assemble the wheels.) It took my spouse and I a few hours to get the thing assembled. I feel that it was ultimately well worth the struggle, but if you're not particularly handy this may be something to keep in mind when considering the purchase.","26 Mar 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Furmax High Back Office Chair Adjustable Ergonomic Desk Chair with Padded Armrests,Executive PU Leather Swivel Task Chair with Lumbar Support (Black)","/Furmax-Executive-Armrests-Adjustable-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07P8DMF9V/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Value for price not quite there","Update: May 17 2020 - Been sitting in this chair for two months now and would NOT recommend. The lumbar support feature is much too low and silly to use. The seat seems to tilt forward (as mentioned in other's reviews) and becomes incredibly uncomfortable after an hour or so. By the end of the day, my back and legs are both sore from constantly adjusting myself. I'd like to note, I have always worked a desk job, sitting all day, so this is definitely a chair issue. This chair was difficult to assemble and the instructions were incredibly vague. Definitely make sure to have a partner on hand to help out. The arms and legs are made out of cheap painted silver plastic material, though the actual seat fabric is very comfortable and at least appears good quality. It seems that, for this price, the arms should be adjustable. They sit incredibly high for me personally. I am 5'5"" and they sit about mid rib cage. All in all, you can certainly find a MUCH nicer chair for the $200 price tag.","19 Mar 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","Errin Cooke","1.0","NOUHAUS +Posture Ergonomic PU Leather Office Chair.

"Ouch","Purchased for my office at our vacation home where I'm working remotely during the pandemic. Let's start with what's good. It's very cushy, roomy and attractive. After that, I can't recommend. It was a real beast to put together. Very difficult to make screws and holes align. The chair doesn't have much flexibility and can't make many adjustments. I couldn't sit in it for more than 20 minutes without getting up to stretch because of how the seat is positioned. If I forgot to get up and move, it would literally take me 10 minutes to be able to stand up straight. After 2 days, I ordered a Herman Miller Celle chair on eBay. Took 20 seconds to assemble.

I had a leather one and the leather had started to crack badly. I wanted a chair that was really nice but didn’t have leather or faux leather so I wouldn’t have to worry about the material cracking. This chair fits the bill perfectly. It’s got really clean lines and is super sleek and chic. It looks really modern with mesh-like backing. It is super comfortable: the padding on the butt is great, the back of the chair is angled perfectly, and the head rest is tilted, which all combine for maximum comfort.

"Decent Chair with good warranty.","I have purchased this chair for my daughter who needs a chair for couple of hours daily. After using it for a few days this is what I felt about this chair. Installation: This is easy if you use only the screws and Allen wrench. I was trying to use the washers provided by and it was not fitting exactly to the nut. once I stopped using the washers everything was falling in place. there are few extra bolts provided so do not bother about them. else installation was completed in around 15-20 minutes. The drawings of installation should have been a bit better. Comfort  & Functionality : Everything works as intended. A decent chair that could be used for 2-3 hours per day. The leather  looks to be of decent quality. I do not seen any issues with the plastic handles as some of reviewers mentioned. Conclusion :One of the reason I have purchased this is because of the warranty which is for 5 years. All in all this is a decent chair for a decent price. Only thing that they should have done is to provide a more simplified installation manual.","29 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611Rlai7ebL._SY88.jpg

"Hurts your butt","This may be the most uncomfortable chair I've ever sat in.  There is some sort of bump on the bottom cushion that presses on your tailbone.  Also, the cushion on the bottom flattened after about 1 day of sitting in it, making the bump even worse.  I only weigh 200 lbs, so I'm within weight limits.  The massager works, but it does not come with a power block, so you'll have to use an old iPhone charger to power it.  Even then, the cable is too short to use the massager without a USB extension cable.  In conclusion - I do not recommend this chair.

"Worst Office Chair Ever - How do you mess up a seat?","I know that this chair was more of an entry-level office chair, so my expectations were not very high to begin with. I wanted to like this chair... I just thought, well it may just need a couple of weeks to ""break-in"".  After a couple of weeks, this chair is breaking me! The most important piece of an office chair is the seat.  How do you mess this up? The seat is made up of two parts: 1. One solid hard plastic square that you sit on.  It is not actually a full seat with support. 2. Everything else is just a very thin piece of form, just to hold the shape of the seat for presentation only. This foam is not used as support or cushion. You can see in the picture, the sunken pieces around the hard square. I would feel bad giving this chair away for free.

"Comfortable chair at a reasonable price","While I like the chair and find it mostly comfortable, I wish it had adjustable lumbar support and the massage feature pulsated more firmly. The massage feature is probably limited by the power source (USB input), so you wouldn't compare it to a dedicated massage chair and should look at it as a novelty add on. Fortunately, the chair was priced the same as others with similar materials that didn't have the massage function.

My very nice neighbor has to carry this huge box over across street to my house. Fine. I was thankful but embarrassed. Then the chair comes with a very short power cord. So short didn’t even reach the floor, so I have to buy extension cord before I can use the massager. Overall, long story for this chair. If it’s not because it’s so big and heavy.

"Excellent chair for the price point. Very small complaints.","After spending many days researching chairs in the sub $200 category, I decided on this one. As you may note, this chair is extremely similar to the Lorell Executive Mesh High Back chair as well as the Alera Elusion High Back chair. Please keep in mind this is a review of a sub-$200 chair and will not be compared to the likes of $800-$1000 chairs, which seems some people like to do for some reason. I work from home at least once per week as well as many hours dedicated to browsing the internet and gaming. So I needed a chair that had a high level of comfort for long periods of time. In this price range, it pretty much came down to a lot of store brand junkers as well as the Ikea Markus (which generally gets very favorable reviews across the board). I came upon the Proline II via PC Gamer's article from 02/05/2015 as their recommendation for budget chair. Bought it and overall am pleased. Overall build construction appears to be very good. So let's do some pros/cons: Pros: - Firm, dense seat cushion that still has plenty of give. I would not describe it as ""plush"", but the end result is that I still don't notice it after eight hours. That is a win when I consider comfort. - Back mesh gives enough support and give. Good amount of lower and center-of-back support. - Casters are silky smooth and move with ease. - Plenty of adjustments available (seat front-to-back adjustment ,armrest height and width adjustment, seat angle adjustment, backrest angle adjustment, backrest tilt tension, and forward tilt). There aren't a ton of chairs at this pricepoint that give these adjustments. Semi-Cons: - For those needing a lot of lumbar support, I don't think this will fit the bill. I would have loved a bit more lumbar support, but I find that if I stay upright I get enough overall support. - The tilt tension seems overly low. Even at it's ""tightest"" tension, the chair back will still move with very little movement. I would have liked a bit more resistance. But I have the backrest locked 90% of the time anyway, so this isn't a huge problem. Cons: - Arrived with a tear/puncture on the bottom of the cushion. There was no damage to the box when it arrived, so I'm not sure what hit it. I've submitted a request to Office Star to remedy this without returning the entire product. If I'm unable to get it repaired, I'm pretty sure it will spread after use. - Arm rests are a fairly hard plastic. Comfort is still there, but be aware that these aren't super soft. Also, even after tightening the knobs to lock them in place, they still have some side-to-side movement. Again, not a dealbreaker, but it's notable. Overall I am highly pleased with this chair and am happy I spent less than $200 to snag it. I feel it is priced well for it's amount of features. As a side note, I certainly don't understand the reviewer who complained of hard-to-understand instructions. The assembly was very straight forward. The ""Mechanism"" they discuss is the only huge part in the entire box (the part that contains all of the adjustment levers). Yes, it's funny that the instructions do ambiguously describe it as ""The Mechanism"", but it's quite clear that is exactly what it is. I assembled it in less than 15 minutes without issue and I would assume most other buyers wouldn't have any issue assembling this chair. The only small quib is that yes, one of the six bolts that attach the mechanism to the chair is a bit tough to get at due to the levers. The supplied allen wrenches will reach it though and shouldn't take more than another minute to tighten down. I'd happily edit this to a five star if I'm able to sort out the fabric tear. Edit: Sent an email to the company with pictures of the tear and filled out a form requesting a new seat. Within a week of confirming the email, they had shipped me out a new seat, no charge. Boosting to five stars, excellent customer service.","19 Mar 2015","Size: High-Back","","Yes","K.A.","5.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great chair until my wife snagged it from me","I ordered this chair be it's similar to the one I have at work. My work chair is a Hermann Miller and, though I love it, I simply don't have that kind of money lying around. When the chair arrived the outer box looked pretty rough. Thankfully the chair was well-packed and had lots of protection from the shipping company. Overall, assembly was straight-forward. The hex key/Allen wrench is kind of useless; I used a socket wrench instead. Pay mind to the instructions on moving the mechanism back when trying to reach and tighten the back bolts underneath the seat. It will make life easier. As soon as the chair was together I tried it out and adjusted it to my liking. I was duly impressed: the chair is very comfortable and supportive, with a strong breathable mesh with just the right amount of give. My wife works from home one day a week so she tried it out. Now she uses it instead of the uncomfortable chair I bought this one to replace. So now I have to get another one unfortunately. Anyhow, the chair is excellent. The feel and construction are of high quality and I look forward to maybe being able to sit in it one day again.","14 Oct 2019","Size: High-Back","","Yes","J.

"Absolutely the worse chair I've ever purchased","I received the box and it was huge and extremely heavy.  I thought that was a good sigh as a sturdy chair should weight a lot.  I pulled everything out of the box and put it together. As soon as I sat on it I knew it was bad. The chair sits very high.  If you're under 6ft good luck touching the floor with your feet.  I tried to adjust it to make it go lower, but no dice.  The height of the seat throws off everything else off so the hand rests were making contact with my desk regardless of what height I put it at.  I thought it was fine as I could still put my feet on the bottom supports and find a comfortable position. I think started to adjust the seat (front to back), btw the chair seats very shallow.  You can't set it any further back than what you get it as  but it will slid forward quite a bit.  I left it at the neutral position and then tried to adjust the back rest.  No matter how I set it and now matter how high or low I put the back rest it just wouldn't sit comfortably.  I pressed myself against the back rest to see if there  was any give and found that it had too much give.  I was able to feel the cross members on the back of the chair. There are multiple adjustments on the chair and all of them worked but one.  The seat tilt adjustment was just moving around loosely.  I tried every different angle and still nothing.  I just ended up giving up and tore the thing down and processed my return.  Don't buy unless you're tall and like a shallow seat with horrible adjustments.","08 Apr 2020","Size: Mid-Back","","Yes","Fractal32","1.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Seriously an awesome chair with multiple adjustments","This really is an awesome chair with multiple adjustments that lock in place.  I like the fact that it has a tilt adjustment that locks in place to where you want it. It has more than one tilt adjustment actually there is one in the front and one in the back there’s also a knob underneath you can twist to make the tilting harder or easier if you choose to leave the tilt unlocked. I prefer the tilt in the back that you can move the seat up or down and lock in the position. Also the seat has a knob that you pull out and you can slide the seat forward or back which is another great adjustment. The back itself has adjustments as well it leans back far.  The armrests have three adjustments as well which is awesome one adjustment allows it to go further away from the sides the second adjustment goes up or down and the third adjustment slides the top part of the pad forward or back. I also bought the headrest which fit perfectly for this chair you just pop out the two little  plastic covers that they have covering screw holes and the head rest came with the perfect screws to fit and it looked perfectly in place. The next thing I purchased separately were the wheels that were recommended they are very nice and quiet they roll a lot smoother than the regular wheels and it goes from my carpet to hardwood with no issues. I highly recommend this chair if you work all day or if you game all day it is very comfortable and adjustable you will not be disappointed.","09 Nov 2017","Size: High-Back","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yL+fTJDPL._SY88.jpg

"Don't bother - terrible product and support","Reviews were pretty good on this so I took a chance.  What a mistake.  Out of the box, it seemed like a good, heavy duty product. for the money.  Assembly instructions are unclear in a couple of key places and no attempt to reach out to the company has resulted in help.  The chair adjustment mechanisms do not work, and the chair is stuck in a tilted forward position, making it unusable.  Instructions have only a Parts number, which takes you to a message line that reads ads for other products to you and then hangs up on you if you don't click through on one of them.  I checked with the website and there is no support line...only corporate line.  They patched me through to a random voice mail. So, if the chair is unusable, it's neither a bargain, nor good quality for the price.  Keep shopping, and look for someone who says they offer back end support for their product.","30 Jan 2020","Size: High-Back","","Yes","Wanda","1.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Breakdowns & lots of Customer Service","When I wrote the following review I had just received my Proline II ProGrid High Back Managers Chair.  Circling back 2 months later.  Exhausted. Here is my UPDATED REVIEW: The chair looked good with lots of functionality.  Amazon does not guarantee a return on this product (beware of this when purchasing products like this through Amazon - and check the manufacturers return instructions before purchase to be fully apprised of what you may need to do if your expensive chair doesn't work properly). In this case, one has to contact the manufacturer, who does not sell directly and suggests you check with Amazon for a replacement.  It's a bit of a dichotomy since one does not support the other.  The company is co-operative in sending out replacement parts (no chance on a full replacement),  first the seat bottom mechanism needed replacing because the tilt lever No.2 did not work and then 2 weeks later the entire cylinder which lifts the chair failed to operate. Fortunately my husband is handy and able to replace each part as it has broken with the replacement part sent by Office Star Products, the manufacturer of this chair.  At this point I've owned the chair for 2 months of only which 2 weeks it was fully operable.  I'm hoping this is the last part replacement and wish I had ordered another model chair. At over $200. this chair should be more reliably made.  I'm disappointed and frustrated, but grateful for the companies willingness to honor their warranty...and for the ability to retrieve my invoice on Amazon.  Don't throw out those seat assembly instructions with company contact info and limited warranty when you receive this chair....you will probably need it...and will be directed to a company website to fill out a parts order form, submit it by email with your receipt and a photo of the chair problem.  A lot of fuss, twice, for what I thought would be a good office chair.  UGH! OLD REVIEW:The chair was delivered faster than the estimated delivery; always nice. Only 20 min to put together, you do need a screw driver.  One of the levers didn't operate.  Within a week I phone Proline customer service and they sent the new part out immediately and didn't require me to send back the part that wasn't functioning (even though I saved the box, just in case). I didn't do this through Amazon as a return, but called ProLine directly, from the phone number listed on the assembly instructions.  Excellent customer service. The chairs levers require a little bit of study to maneuver.  Ex.  push down on this one while pulling on that one.  The levers control seat tilt, adjustable arms, adjustable back, seat slide and chair height, give this office chair the customization of a much more expensive model.  The seat is comfy and very roomy, the back firm, the arms even adjust width and height-wise for perfect computer keyboard positioning. I find I adjust through the day for different needs; when working I keep the seat back tight to my lower back which needs support, when relaxing, I release the back and lean back and its' easy to do. The wheels are sturdy.  I spent a long time deciding which chair I wanted since I am in marketing and spend long days on the computer.  Ergonomics were important to me and this chair provides those adjustments. Not sure this would be a chair for an industrial space as it doesn't have stainless steel parts, but rather plastic/acrylic/moulded, but great for an acrylic floor chair mat over office carpeting. Will circle back in 6 months to weigh in on longevity and continued functioning.","25 Apr 2016","Size: High-Back","","Yes","VivaGreene","2.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great chair, poor instructions. How to enable free-float!","I figured out how to rid myself of that pesky forward float it ships in and enabling free-float! For those that have been suffering with the seat resting too far forward: - lift up lever 2 (the one that locks the lower tilt) - under your seat is a downward facing knob, turn it right to loosen it. don't worry, it'll stop on its own - you'll notice the tension of the forward facing has loosened, sit on your chair - lock lever 2 and lever 3 (lower and back tilting) - lean all the way back with your hand on the first lever pushing forward. Once you've leaned back far enough, the lever will lock into position, finally losing that pesky forward facing action. It took me quite some time to figure this out. I was simply locking the bottom adjustment in place, but I didn't like the idea of having a free-float feature and it didn't make sense that a chair this fully featured wouldn't have that option. I hope this helps everyone.","12 Mar 2017","Size: High-Back","","Yes","Richard Macias","5.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Absolutely the worse chair I've ever purchased","I received the box and it was huge and extremely heavy.  I thought that was a good sigh as a sturdy chair should weight a lot.  I pulled everything out of the box and put it together. As soon as I sat on it I knew it was bad. The chair sits very high.  If you're under 6ft good luck touching the floor with your feet.  I tried to adjust it to make it go lower, but no dice.  The height of the seat throws off everything else off so the hand rests were making contact with my desk regardless of what height I put it at.  I thought it was fine as I could still put my feet on the bottom supports and find a comfortable position. I think started to adjust the seat (front to back), btw the chair seats very shallow.  You can't set it any further back than what you get it as  but it will slid forward quite a bit.  I left it at the neutral position and then tried to adjust the back rest.  No matter how I set it and now matter how high or low I put the back rest it just wouldn't sit comfortably.  I pressed myself against the back rest to see if there  was any give and found that it had too much give.  I was able to feel the cross members on the back of the chair. There are multiple adjustments on the chair and all of them worked but one.  The seat tilt adjustment was just moving around loosely.  I tried every different angle and still nothing.  I just ended up giving up and tore the thing down and processed my return.  Don't buy unless you're tall and like a shallow seat with horrible adjustments.","08 Apr 2020","Size: Mid-Back","","Yes","Fractal32","1.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Seriously an awesome chair with multiple adjustments","This really is an awesome chair with multiple adjustments that lock in place.  I like the fact that it has a tilt adjustment that locks in place to where you want it. It has more than one tilt adjustment actually there is one in the front and one in the back there’s also a knob underneath you can twist to make the tilting harder or easier if you choose to leave the tilt unlocked. I prefer the tilt in the back that you can move the seat up or down and lock in the position. Also the seat has a knob that you pull out and you can slide the seat forward or back which is another great adjustment. The back itself has adjustments as well it leans back far.  The armrests have three adjustments as well which is awesome one adjustment allows it to go further away from the sides the second adjustment goes up or down and the third adjustment slides the top part of the pad forward or back. I also bought the headrest which fit perfectly for this chair you just pop out the two little  plastic covers that they have covering screw holes and the head rest came with the perfect screws to fit and it looked perfectly in place. The next thing I purchased separately were the wheels that were recommended they are very nice and quiet they roll a lot smoother than the regular wheels and it goes from my carpet to hardwood with no issues. I highly recommend this chair if you work all day or if you game all day it is very comfortable and adjustable you will not be disappointed.","09 Nov 2017","Size: High-Back","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yL+fTJDPL._SY88.jpg

"Don't bother - terrible product and support","Reviews were pretty good on this so I took a chance.  What a mistake.  Out of the box, it seemed like a good, heavy duty product. for the money.  Assembly instructions are unclear in a couple of key places and no attempt to reach out to the company has resulted in help.  The chair adjustment mechanisms do not work, and the chair is stuck in a tilted forward position, making it unusable.  Instructions have only a Parts number, which takes you to a message line that reads ads for other products to you and then hangs up on you if you don't click through on one of them.  I checked with the website and there is no support line...only corporate line.  They patched me through to a random voice mail. So, if the chair is unusable, it's neither a bargain, nor good quality for the price.  Keep shopping, and look for someone who says they offer back end support for their product.","30 Jan 2020","Size: High-Back","","Yes","Wanda","1.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Breakdowns & lots of Customer Service","When I wrote the following review I had just received my Proline II ProGrid High Back Managers Chair.  Circling back 2 months later.  Exhausted. Here is my UPDATED REVIEW: The chair looked good with lots of functionality.  Amazon does not guarantee a return on this product (beware of this when purchasing products like this through Amazon - and check the manufacturers return instructions before purchase to be fully apprised of what you may need to do if your expensive chair doesn't work properly). In this case, one has to contact the manufacturer, who does not sell directly and suggests you check with Amazon for a replacement.  It's a bit of a dichotomy since one does not support the other.  The company is co-operative in sending out replacement parts (no chance on a full replacement),  first the seat bottom mechanism needed replacing because the tilt lever No.2 did not work and then 2 weeks later the entire cylinder which lifts the chair failed to operate. Fortunately my husband is handy and able to replace each part as it has broken with the replacement part sent by Office Star Products, the manufacturer of this chair.  At this point I've owned the chair for 2 months of only which 2 weeks it was fully operable.  I'm hoping this is the last part replacement and wish I had ordered another model chair. At over $200. this chair should be more reliably made.  I'm disappointed and frustrated, but grateful for the companies willingness to honor their warranty...and for the ability to retrieve my invoice on Amazon.  Don't throw out those seat assembly instructions with company contact info and limited warranty when you receive this chair....you will probably need it...and will be directed to a company website to fill out a parts order form, submit it by email with your receipt and a photo of the chair problem.  A lot of fuss, twice, for what I thought would be a good office chair.  UGH! OLD REVIEW:The chair was delivered faster than the estimated delivery; always nice. Only 20 min to put together, you do need a screw driver.  One of the levers didn't operate.  Within a week I phone Proline customer service and they sent the new part out immediately and didn't require me to send back the part that wasn't functioning (even though I saved the box, just in case). I didn't do this through Amazon as a return, but called ProLine directly, from the phone number listed on the assembly instructions.  Excellent customer service. The chairs levers require a little bit of study to maneuver.  Ex.  push down on this one while pulling on that one.  The levers control seat tilt, adjustable arms, adjustable back, seat slide and chair height, give this office chair the customization of a much more expensive model.  The seat is comfy and very roomy, the back firm, the arms even adjust width and height-wise for perfect computer keyboard positioning. I find I adjust through the day for different needs; when working I keep the seat back tight to my lower back which needs support, when relaxing, I release the back and lean back and its' easy to do. The wheels are sturdy.  I spent a long time deciding which chair I wanted since I am in marketing and spend long days on the computer.  Ergonomics were important to me and this chair provides those adjustments. Not sure this would be a chair for an industrial space as it doesn't have stainless steel parts, but rather plastic/acrylic/moulded, but great for an acrylic floor chair mat over office carpeting. Will circle back in 6 months to weigh in on longevity and continued functioning.","25 Apr 2016","Size: High-Back","","Yes","VivaGreene","2.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great chair, poor instructions. How to enable free-float!","I figured out how to rid myself of that pesky forward float it ships in and enabling free-float! For those that have been suffering with the seat resting too far forward: - lift up lever 2 (the one that locks the lower tilt) - under your seat is a downward facing knob, turn it right to loosen it. don't worry, it'll stop on its own - you'll notice the tension of the forward facing has loosened, sit on your chair - lock lever 2 and lever 3 (lower and back tilting) - lean all the way back with your hand on the first lever pushing forward. Once you've leaned back far enough, the lever will lock into position, finally losing that pesky forward facing action. It took me quite some time to figure this out. I was simply locking the bottom adjustment in place, but I didn't like the idea of having a free-float feature and it didn't make sense that a chair this fully featured wouldn't have that option. I hope this helps everyone.","12 Mar 2017","Size: High-Back","","Yes","Richard Macias","5.0","Office Star High Back ProGrid Back FreeFlex Seat with Adjustable Arms and Multi-Function and Seat Slider, Black Managers Chair","/Office-Star-FreeFlex-Adjustable-Multi-Function/product-reviews/B00450P182/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

Allen wrenches are convenient but the one included is awkwardly long.* I purchased two of these chairs. The first one I put together as instructed.

This was much easier for me personally. 4 stars for value because the price jumped from 49.99 to 79.99 within hours.

"Not comfortable","After sitting for an hour or so, you realize how thin the seat cushion is - not comfortable after a while. I could live with that. A simple hack would be to add a small pillow. What I can’t fix is the arm rest design. The cross section is a “T” shape and therefore a small radius is facing your thighs. It’s hard plastic and not padded so I find this digging into my legs. Furthermore, the arm rest attachment point to the seat is rather far forward, increasing likelihood of touching your thighs. Maybe I can hack with pipe insulation foam? But 2 hacks for a brand new chair? I thought others should know before spending their money. I wouldn’t buy this chair again.

"It is  a basic $60.00 chair, that I hope my daughter can tolerate, for online schooling at home","So, first thing first, it is a $60.00 chair.  I just bought a $40.00 repair kit for my other expensive but older chair.  So, I need to put this in perspective. My 12-year-old likes the chair.  Mainly because it’s her chair.  But I can tell that the chair will fail her within the year.  When she sits down the cylinder already starts to compress. The seat cushion, well its not that good either, but it is a $60.00 chair.  I suppose that if someone over 140 lbs. had to use the chair, it would fail withing 45 days. However, It is a $60 dollar chair. After starting the process of writing this review, my other daughter will need a chair soon.  For sure, I will not buy this chair for her.  This purchase is just good enough not to send it back.  It is a basic $60.00 chair, that I hope, my daughter can sit in for 4 to 5 hours of the day.  It is nothing more than that.  So even at its price point it is a 3.5-star rated product at most.  Spend a little more and get a better product. Update, after two days of use, the chair was put in the corner and replaced with another chair that we had in the house.  Rating was changed to two stars..  The chair is just not comfortable.  Too much hassle to take apart to send back....  spend a little more and get a more comfortable product.","25 Jul 2020","Color: Black","","Yes","The Dub","2.0","Home Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair with Lumbar Support Armrest Executive Rolling Swivel Adjustable Mid Back Task Chair for Women Adults, Black","/Black-Office-Chair-Computer-Adjustable/product-reviews/B00FS3VJAO/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

The breathable mesh back keeps me fairly cool. -The chair are very easy to move around on a wooden floor. the wheels are good swivels and rolls with ease. -The seat height is adjustable and the height adjustment works great. -Upon opening the box, I found that all parts and hardware were clearly labeled, and the tools with a allen wrench were also provided.

"Great chair, difficult to assemble following the instruction","I bought this chair to replace my similar purchase from Walmart. So far I am pretty happy with it. It took me about 30 minutes to fully assemble it, a bit longer than anticipated. The most difficult assembly was from the arm rest, back rest, and the cushion. The manuals instructs to put the arm rests and the cushion together first, before installing the back rest. I found it very difficult to do so. Instead, I installed the arm rests to the back rest first, then the cushion just went in much easier. The rest of the assembly was just a walk in the park. The chair once assembled is incredibly comfortable. It does not create any sound when moved around or sat on. The meshed backrest is soft and comfortable. The base of the chair is pure metal. The base is very heavy and stable and feels solid. Overall, I am very happy with this chair's construction.","11 Jul 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vbwt4Y9sL._SY88.jpg

What you should do is connect the back rest to arms first then do them as a set to the main chair.

"Impressive chair I'm glad I purchased!","It arrived early and assembled it very fast as it had directions and all the hardware I needed clearly labeled! I used it for a while now and here are my thoughts. I like that is sturdy and fits in my desk perfectly. The rollers are smooth and make the chair move around with no much effort on any surface. The back is made out of mesh material which is great because it ventilates and doesn't get hot. Also the seat is made out of a thick pad that makes this chair super comfy and in addition you can easily adjust the height of it to your preference. Most importantly it has a curved back for lumbar support that definitely has help my back not to hurt after seating for hours working on the computer. Absolutely a good buy, I'm glad I did.","14 May 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xOglEhp9L._SY88.jpg

"Comfortable, Easy to Assemble, and Reasonable Price","I bought this chair for my son. It took me only about half an hour (below my expectation) to assemble the chair with the help of its instructions manual and assemble tools that came with it; it’s so easy to assemble as long as you follow all the required steps in the instructions manual. I and my son felt very comfortable sitting on the chair for long hours due to its good lumbar support, ergonomic arm rests, and thick padding seat. Price is also very reasonable for this kind of chair, much cheaper than my old fabric office chair, that will be donated soon. My son is happy with this gift of chair from me. I hope that this chair is durable enough, longer than the provided warranty period that I never expect to claim.","03 May 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XGo17L8lL._SY88.jpg

"Great affordable office chair for a small office.","The Smugdesk mid-back big ergonomic office chair is a great affordable office chair for a small office. The chair was bought for a larger person (6'+) and fits him perfectly without being too large for the office space. Assembly was great with little hiccups. It's was as simple as putting together the base, the arms, and then the back. Packaging came in a non-discript box and was nicely put together. Ergonomics fit the body well. No issues with sitting for long periods.","15 Jul 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TfK6xIgtL._SY88.jpg

"Uncomfortable, Imbalanced & Low Quality Materials","PROS: Price, Shipping, Easy to Assemble CONS: Uncomfortable (Elbows, Thighs), Questionable Finishes, Exposed Materials I purchased this product over the past weekend and it arrived within a few business days. Shipping expectations were well met. Upon opening the box, I found that all parts and hardware were clearly labeled, and tools (a single allen wrench) were also provided. Building the chair is straightforward. Just be sure to pay attention as the screws provided are of different (but similar) lengths. Upon completing instruction, I inspected the chair. As shown in the photos that accompany this review, there were obvious blemishes, faded finishes and stress marks on the chair frame itself. There were also some exposed edges. When I first sat in the chair I worried that I had missed a step. It was wobbily and rocked a bit from side to side. I ran through the instructions once more, checking all screws and veriying that it was correct. Still, the chair continues to feel uneasy to sit in. There is a large amount of play or ""wobble"" in the seat bolster itself and you can feel plenty of side to side movement. It's to the point that if I sit still and tun my head, it forces the chair to tilt to that side. The lumbar support is simply ""okay"" at best. It seems a bit lacking, in my experience. The armrests are effectively useless. I stand 6' tall and sitting straight up, my elbows and forearms cannot make contact with the arms at all. They are a good 3 to 4 inches too short for me. Another issue with the armrests is that unless you sit with your knees touching, your thighs will likely push against the fixed arms, causing additional discomfort. Overall thr chair looks good enough in the ""you get what you pay for"" sense, but I cannot recommend this if you're looking for a comfortable and supportive chair that you can work in throughout the course of the day.","21 Nov 2018","Color: Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IdD3G8vPL._SY88.jpg

"Spend More","If you have never built a chair before this review might just help you out.. The little marks are normal as it is on both sides (probably from the factory). Pros- Unlike the other reviews all the parts came with nothing broken and the screws were not stripped. Packaging was on each part to make sure they were protected. Instructions were useful in telling you which screws and what they recommend. (see cons) The chair is a lot more stable than you think, but it does say on the instructions to not stand on the chair. Gives you enough height for any type of office desk (it was a little too high for me).. I was surprised how light it was from my older chair. The wheels are very easy to move around on a wooden floor. A lot of support on your back and leaning is easy. Cons- The instructions for step 2 will make it difficult for any beginner, I recommend putting the armrests on the back first to get rid of any future problems then screwing it onto the seat since the armrests are easier to move around the holes. Armrests are very low for someone around 6 ft tall and may need more to rest elbows comfortably. The tool they give you may make things tough, but at least they gave you a tool. Overall, this is a great chair for the price and does not have any defects in its design. I do feel more support on one side than the other, but it might be my fault for not doing something properly. I should mention that this feels comfortable for a big guy right under 250 lbs. Edit: No longer have the chair and didn’t last 3 months..

"ok for the price.","I'm a 6' male at around 140lbs. The kneww bend high is totally fine.  The width of the seat... the arm rests just touches into both my outer thighs.  just enough thta after several hours of being in the chair, my outer thighs feel it! Tolerable, but i can still feel the slight pressure still on my thighs when I stand up.  Also, the seat plate tends to bow in the center and after several hours and days of sitting in this chair, it's like sitting on a metal mound.  I know i'm not the lightest person in the world and for the price point that this chair is at, nit bad! But if you are on the larger side of the scale, like me, the supports in the chair will start to give after a short amount of time.

"DONT RECOMMEND!","""Because it makes your work easier."" This could be true if you are a master plastic manipulator and normally deal with much more challenging issues, then yes. This will ADD a much simpler piece of work into your life. Unfortunately, I am not a master plastic manipulator. Putting the chair together didn't seem too challenging until I got near the end and one of the screws wouldn't keep the armrest connected to the seat. It seemed that the screw-hole wasn't made correctly on the seat. I called and told them this and they sent me a new seat piece in less than a week. Unfortunately, it seems as if this seat isn't meant to fit with the rest of the chair pieces I had. I tried my best to force the armrests to bend as much as they possibly could by pushing it, sitting on it, using all my might and it just won't work. I called and told them this. They recommend me send everything back and they'd send me a new one. Unfortunately, they must have taken my email down incorrectly because I never received an email from them with the label to send the chair back. I have instead decided to just send it back to Amazon for a refund. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CHAIR. It's a decent price and hopefully you may be luckier than I got, but from my experience, I'd rather pay more money for an actual chair than pay this for a pile of spare parts that won't fit together. 1 star for seeming like it has the potential to one day grow up into a decent chair.

Unfortunately, they must have taken my email down incorrectly because I never received an email from them with the label to send the chair back. I have instead decided to just send it back to Amazon for a refund. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CHAIR. It's a decent price and hopefully you may be luckier than I got, but from my experience, I'd rather pay more money for an actual chair than pay this for a pile of spare parts that won't fit together. 1 star for seeming like it has the potential to one day grow up into a decent chair. My parts just weren't there yet.","21 Feb 2019","Color: Black","","Yes","Alisa Grace","1.0","Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair Lumbar Support Modern Executive Adjustable Stool Rolling Swivel Chair for Back Pain, Black","/Ergonomic-Computer-Office-Midback-Chair/product-reviews/B0147WIC7E/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Not good for working from home full time","If you work from home full time now, spend the extra $ on a more comfortable chair. The back support is decent, but the seat cushion isn’t made for long hours of use. I’ve had for a month now and I’m looking for a replacement because the padding in the seat ends up to be non-existent towards the end of the day.. I work over 8 hours a day so if this is a chair that’s supporting you for hours and days on end... do not get it!! I can feel the flat wood/bottom of the seat after sitting down so the cousin/padding is not a solid/supportive padding to be sat on for regular+ work hours/days.","11 Aug 2020","","","Yes","James Weverka","1.0","KOLLIEE Armless Mesh Office Chair Ergonomic Comfortable Armless Desk Chair Small Black Adjustable Computer Chair No Armrest Mid Back Swivel Task Chair for Small Spaces","/KOLLIEE-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Adjustable-Computer/product-reviews/B087BSZM8T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Not for long sit-downs.","I was a bit disappointed with the cushion. This chair is not meant for long sit downs. I could feel the plastic underneath after a day on this chair. I ended up buying a $20 cushion which I velcro-ed on to the chairs cushion which has solved the comfort issue for now, but I wish this $80 chair came with a thicker cushion like some others on Amazon. At least assembly was a breeze and the chair seems pretty solid otherwise.","10 Jul 2020","","","Yes","FMEN","3.0","KOLLIEE Armless Mesh Office Chair Ergonomic Comfortable Armless Desk Chair Small Black Adjustable Computer Chair No Armrest Mid Back Swivel Task Chair for Small Spaces","/KOLLIEE-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Adjustable-Computer/product-reviews/B087BSZM8T/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Chair Broke after 9 Months","UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY. After finding ""Cavalier Store"" which is the true seller here, they informed me that the 1 Year 100% Satisfaction warranty is an ""Error in the listing"" (Seriously?) and that the true warranty is 90 Days. When I told them I bought the chair for the warranty and that they had falsely advertised their product they told me they would send me a replacement cushion. Here I am almost a month later with no replacement cushion. After contacting them once more they told me essentially that they changed their mind and decided not to send the cushion. I've had to go through Amazon's Fraud Protection department to file a claim. Hopefully I will get a refund within a couple weeks. It's a comfortable chair. Feels (emphasis on feels) well built. Recline is nice and pillow is nicely situated. Bought and assembled in January this year, over the last month I noticed myself leaning more and more to the right. Today I deconstructed the chair thinking all I needed was to tighten it up a bit only to find that the bottom right fastener on the bottom cushion had splintered and broken the wood. Trying to find someone to contact about replacing the part because it has a 1 year warranty was NOT easy. I spent a solid 30 minutes trying to find someone to send a warranty claim request to and I'm STILL not sure. I'll update this review once I hopefully hear back from someone. If I don't I'll be changing my review to a one star, unfortunately being the least I can do at that point.

"Very nice!","The chair arrived a day early, so that was a plus, but it also arrived with a big whole in the top of the box. I was not happy about that. Luckily nothing was missing. It took my husband about 20 minutes, if not less to put it together and he is not the most handy handyman! So it is pretty easy to put it together. It is very comfortable to sit in. The chair itself feels kind of leathery. It looks to be well made, but time will tell. As you can see from the pictures the arms go all the way up and the head pillow just slips over the top part of the chair. You don't have to add it if you don't want to. The chair does lean back a little bit, but you have to pull the lever under the chair and then push back. It also doesn't take up a lot of space. Everything considered, it seems like a very good chair and worth the money. My husband is very happy with it and it is big improvement over what he was sitting in. I would highly recommend this chair.","04 Oct 2018","Color: Black/White","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61v5FJsOxNL._SY88.jpg

"One of the worst chair purchases I have made to date","Everything's good so far. Comfortable. Update: a few months after making my initial review the metal in the base started separating from the base underneath the chair where the cheap welds are. It's not even the welding job the actual metal tore through and the chair leans back far to the left to the point of being unusable. I would rate this lower than 1 star if I could. I just keep reminding myself you get what you pay for. For reference I weigh 180lbs. I am also super careful with it. I don't know how this could have happened.","06 Jan 2018","Color: Black/White","","Yes","Donnie B.","1.0","BestOffice PC Gaming Chair Ergonomic Office Chair Desk Chair with Lumbar Support Flip Up Arms Headrest PU Leather Executive High Back Computer Chair for Adults Women Men, Black and White","/BestMassage-Office-Desk-Gaming-Chair/product-reviews/B01ICHJIM8/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"worth my recommendation","I had done quite a lot research on Amazon, as an ergonomic chair is quite expensive to me. I bought this chair due to its unique selling points such as plating steel back and spring lumbar support. I can’t find other similar chairs with similar price. The box was hard and intact, and the packaging was very well. All parts had been protected well. All in good condition! The most impressive part of this chair is the back, which is made of strong plating steel. This is very uncommon for chairs at this price range. Compare with other chairs using plastic, this back looks much smarter and more durable. However, this need to be tested by time. Another point needs to be emphasized is the lumbar support. As mentioned by the seller, there are springs inside the back, which provides nice lumbar support with good resilience. I guess people in different sizes and weights can experience different lumbar support by adjusting the seating positions. This is quite a special design I have never tried before. The headrest is obviously larger than usual, and I do agree that the foam headrest is softer and more comfortable than mesh headrest after some period of use. The armrest feels soft and supportive due its waved paddings. The wheels are very smooth and quiet, and I can move the chair easily. Something not satisfied with the chair? The assembly took me more than 30 minutes which was longer than I expected. However, the after sales support was nice and supportive. They solved my issue very soon. Overall, this was acceptable for a comfortable chair. Also, the so called hip design and waterfall edge design is not very significant to me. However, the seat cushion is thick and soft, which is comfortable enough for me. To sum up, this is a really high value chair with very unique selling points. I think there  are not many comparable chairs selling online. I may update if I find something not good after longer period of usage.","11 Mar 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Rk9MWJTHL._SY88.jpg

"Good Chair!","Let's make this easy. Pro: The value is very good. It's hard to find a decent office chair at a price point less than 200. I am not mechanically inclined so I opted for professional installation. It took the guy 15 minutes to assemble and he was nice. I'm sure the average handy person could put it together and save on cost. I wanted things done right and one time. Unknown: I got this for my mother. This chair is surprisingly light and I was initially concerned about support. If you have injuries or physically need more supportive materials, I'm not sure if this is the right one for you. My mother hasn't had any issue so far and uses it on a fairly consistent basis for work.","26 Apr 2020","","","Yes","Glasses Case","5.0","Ticova Ergonomic Office Chair - High Back Desk Chair with Elastic Lumbar Support & Thick Seat Cushion - 140°Reclining & Rocking Mesh Computer Chair with Adjustable Headrest, Armrest","/Ticova-Ergonomic-Office-Chair-140%C2%B0Reclining/product-reviews/B08DN1635Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Absolutely Awesome! Comfortable Chair, firm back support and neck support!","I was recently moving to a new house and brought a lot on amazon, so here is my review for this amazing chair, out of my expectation! I brought the chair days ago and it arrived in just 2 days. The installation was not time consuming and very easy to follow the instructions they gave, and they also provide the tools, which was very sweet and considerate. it only took me 20 min or so to finish installation. To me the chair is too great for this price, as I walked around Staples and other furniture stores, I didn't expect the chair of this quality to be just a little over 100 bucks! all the accessories are well designed and protected by an additional plastic layer which looks high-end and beautiful. The most amazing part as I showed in my video and photos is that the back and neck support when you laying on the chair, the chair back can flexibly and smoothly adjust to the angle at your comfort plus I can easily make it maintain the position simply by pulling a handle below the seats. The wheels under the chair are of good quality and don't make noise on my wooden floor. I was concerning as some of the reviews mentioned that the chair will slip when people sit down, well, it never happen in my case, I guess you just need to follow the instructions and everything goes on well. I really enjoy this chair and the sense of being in a sifi movie. and it looks professional and clean. Ill give it a 10 out of 5 if possible, so far my most satisfied item I brought on Amazon.","21 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NaPZIWMLL._SY88.jpg

"wonderful chair","For many years, I have had to put up with some really flaky chairs, some selling for ridiculous amounts of money (waht a waste). And they all had the same things in common: the seat cushion was irritating, the seat back provided almost no support leading to a lot of back pain(which i have to buy a back support every time ), and I always had to stick a small pillow to provide a token amount of lumbar relief. This chair had NONE of those problems! I bought it on JUL after my second chair retired , and in its fourteen day of continuous daily use, it is the undisputed chair champ! My purchase came after a virtually endless amount of research online - every chair that seemed to hold some promise fell apart when I read the reviews (and most review is so long and unreal, i guess there must be paid for wiring those fake reviews)- even as I kept moving up the price points. I finally decided to go test out the chairs that were available on Amazon since I always shop here and good after sales return policy if anything went wrong instead of go to each store to test and compare the cost- and I wasn't disappointed! I even dozed off in the chair, and when I woke up, there was none of the aches and pains that were indigenous to all the other chairs I had to live with. Get yourself one while it's still in stock!","08 Sep 2019","","","Yes","tongmingfan","5.0","HOMEFUN Ergonomic Office Chair, High Back Adjustable Desk Task Chair with Armrests Black with Lumbar Support","/HOMEFUN-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Armrests-Support/product-reviews/B084WWQB5B/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Terrible, do not buy","So I got this because it has a mesh back which I thought would be cooler since I am in a chair for work for hours at a time.  The assembly instructions were terrible, the knob that controls the height wasn't installed and was just lying in the box with the bolt and other two piece, but were not on the instructions at all.  Also it doesn't hold that back up well at all if you use the arms to stand up it slides the back down with any sort of pressure at all, which defeats the second reason I got it because I am tall and wanted a taller chair to support my head/neck.  Next its is uncomfortable.  The cushion at the top of the chair is hard and sticks out so that the bottom of it jams into my back, especially after it slides back down after standing up once.  The seat cushion is mediocre.  The only positive what so ever I can say is that the mesh does keep my back cooler, otherwise this is a miserable product.","26 Jun 2020","Color: Black Without Footrest","","Yes","Amazon Customer","1.0","HOMEFUN Ergonomic Office Chair, High Back Adjustable Desk Task Chair with Armrests Black with Lumbar Support","/HOMEFUN-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Armrests-Support/product-reviews/B084WWQB5B/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great product","This is a suitable chair for my study room computer desk. I came across the style of this chair and made the purchase. It was an enjoyable purchase. I got it now in front of my desktop in replace of the old wooden chair. It suits my place well and give me a lot of comforts when I use my computer for long hours. There are a few things I want to comment on this product: 1. The installation of the chair is easy to achieve with one person if following closely with the manual. It could be a little intriguing if you have no experience in using tools and screws to put different compartments together. If you could however, the chair is stable and durable if assembled properly. 2. The chair has a fancy looking with its stylish modern looking back. Aside from that, it is designed with a meshed chair back which gives more air flow for warm weather. I haven’t test it for the moment, but it feels comfortable when air is flowing behind my back. 3. The pillow is located just behind my neck. I can easily rest in my chair when I was tired now. As the pillow is at fixed position, it is recommended you check the size first before making a decision. 4. The high back gives strong back support. I can easily lie down when i recline the back. The angle of backrest, could serve me a high-quality snap if i need and will.","08 Aug 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Fj+C54HgL._SY88.jpg

"Very sleek looking chair","I was looking get a new ergonomic office chair to replace an old chair I had.  The features that were important to me were: 1. Ergonomic and comfortable for long periods of time. 2. Mesh (gets really hot in California, also not as disgusting as cloth and leather which absorb sweat). 3. Reclines far enough to actually rest in. 4. Looks contemporary and can fit in any color office or environment. This chair hit the mark on all my requirements.  Shipping was really fast, and came in a decent size box, not too heavy.  Setup was super easy.  If you can follow simple picture instructions (like something from Ikea) you can do this easily.  Took me less than 30 mins to fully assemble the chair.  I had a very small blemish on one of my arm wrest, still functional, and the company was very fast to respond to my email.  They went above and beyond to resolve my issue and make sure I was happy.","09 Sep 2019","Color: White With Footrest","","Yes","Tommy T.","5.0","HOMEFUN Ergonomic Office Chair, High Back Adjustable Desk Task Chair with Armrests Black with Lumbar Support","/HOMEFUN-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Armrests-Support/product-reviews/B084WWQB5B/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Super elastic, super durable","This chair its by far the lighest and the most durable i've ever had in my life, it may not look like it can take up heavy pressure on the back support but its way more durable and elastic than it looks. the seat ares very soft, it felt like they've added another layers of cushion on top of another. its very bouncy, even thought it may feel kinda thick but surprisingly it doesn't generate too much heat, it stays cool, If the manufacturers see's this review, please tell me what did you put in the seat that reduces heat. overall this was an AMAZING purchase, I would highly suggest that if you're looking for something lightweight and easy installation, then this is your best choice, the whole process of putting this shoe together probably only took me around 5 mins, its just so easy to install i don't even have to read the manual.","07 Jul 2020","Color: Black Without Footrest","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J7my0olzL._SY88.jpg

The quality is very good and my friend even though it's a very expensive one because the material does not feel like the cheap plastic at all, there are parts that can support my head and back, aka One-piece headrest that was way better than normal headrest. For people like me who need to stare at the screen for a long time every day, this product truly helps protect my back and neck. All in all, I like this chair very much and my friend also wants to buy one after trying mine. I'll recommend it to others. The most important is that the chair is very comfortable.

":)","Let's start from the unboxing state to the actual use. Unboxing: All of the parts and pieces are well padded and wrapped. Assembly: The product uses hex screws and comes with a hex wrench, as expected. Wheels just need to be popped in place. Overall assembly took me roughly 15 minutes. Comfort: The cushion of the chair is nice, gets the job done. I don't feel any unwanted pressure points, but still decided to use my Purple chair cushion anyway after testing the chair's seat for a few days of work. The arm rests have nice grooves for your fingers if you like to grip the chair and stretch out every now and then. There is a lumbar support cushion installed on the chair that I think works well. I've tinkered around with the head rest and while it does get the job done, I probably would be able to fall asleep on it since the headrest and back support are in 1 piece. I guess it's for the best that way. Moving around: The chair rises and drops smoothly. There is an option to lock the backward rocking of the chair or keep it free, which I keep locked because the free is a little bit too free for me. The wheels that come with this chair work well on hardwood floors. There was separate wheels that you can not buy form them, but i contact them, the will place it in the future, wheels work well on carpet as well and are quieter. Overall: A great office chair. I wish that there was a little bit more upper back support but I don't think it's bad enough to knock off a star. The price is fair and the product is well-made, nice quality.","09 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715PXvaaroL._SY88.jpg

Note, this chair comes disassembled and comes in a rather large box, so be aware of that for delivery.  The chair was sent out quickly.  Assembly took about 25 minutes and the provided directions were thin but adequate for the number of parts this chair needed. Sitting in the chair at first is a bit weird, partly due to the raised cushion area that sits toward the front of the cushion right under your thighs.  It takes some time to adjust to the fact that it is there, but I have noticed my posture forced to improve and less strain on my knees and thighs after close to 8 hours per in the chair.  Don't be put off by, it and take some time to adjust as it definitely has long term benefits and is comfortable in a non-traditional way.  The rubberized wheels allow it to glide on laminate and tile floor, but I havent tested it on carpet to see how it moves.  All in all a great price for a really nice and comfy chair that has some side-effects for posture and your sitting health.","30 Apr 2019","","","Yes","Rosh D.","5.0","Office Chair Leather, Mid Back Home Office Chair Bonded Leather Computer Swivel Task Desk Chair - White","/ORVEAY-Ergonomic-Leather-Computer-Armrests/product-reviews/B07VML93GL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great chair at a great value","Due to current events, I have been working at home the past few weeks like so many others. This is not my normal work set up so my kitchen table has quickly become my temporary office. I work 10 hour days and let me just say, sitting on a kitchen chair for that amount of time is very hard your back. I desperately needed an office chair but did not want to invest hundreds of dollars. I decided on this chair and it is great. It was very easy to put together and only took around 15 minutes. It came with extra hardware in case it was needed and was labeled as 'extra'. I like that the seat height is adjustable and the chair it has a slight recline to it so I can prop my feet up on something and sit back and relax while on conference calls. The entire chair is sturdy and well made, though I do wish the seat was a little wider - it feels a little narrow in my opinion but not uncomfortable. Sitting in the chair feels comfortable; I am now able to work my full 10 hour days without pain.

"Perfect if you're petite.","I bought this just prior to starting nursing school in anticipation of long days of studying. I also work online and spend a lot of time sitting at a desk. I can sit in this chair for hours at a time and not feel soreness in my back or tailbone. It's only been about two months but the cushion and back support show no signs of deflating or flattening even with constant use. It was extremely simple to put together as well, and I feel the material, while not true leather, is reasonably durable (I'm not particularly rough with my possessions). A taller person would probably find issue with the height of the chair back. It's only just tall enough for me and I'm short. If you are a larger person or really wide in the hips you may find the width a bit small. Nevertheless, it's a perfect chair for me and I believe it will last me quite a while.","05 Feb 2018","","","Yes","Kimberly","5.0","The HON Company BSXVST305 Sadie Leather Executive Computer/Office Arms-Ergonomic Swivel Chair (HVST305), Black","/HON-Leather-Executive-Computer-Office/product-reviews/B06Y41KLTN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good quality materials; easy to assemble.","I was impressed with how the parts felt heavy and of good quality. I liked how the parts were labeled well, even down to labeling the extra ones as spares! The ONLY thing that was bad was the screw caps never fit flush; I gave up trying. But all in all assembly was left than 30 minutes. Oh and be CAREFUL when you attach the leg assembly to the bottom of the chair! The front of the cushion IS labeled FRONT but the assy drawing misleads. JUST make sure the round tilt control is in the front of the chair when you screw the four bolts in. After sitting in it a few minutes I had to add a pillow. The reason is that the front part of the seat cushion is higher and thicker than the place where your rear goes. I am sure a lady would have no issues but as a man it does compress my um parts.","11 Feb 2018","","","Yes","Southern gent","4.0","The HON Company BSXVST305 Sadie Leather Executive Computer/Office Arms-Ergonomic Swivel Chair (HVST305), Black","/HON-Leather-Executive-Computer-Office/product-reviews/B06Y41KLTN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Fantastic chair","OMG, this chair is a LIFE-SAVER, I am loving my chair. This particular chair was super easy to put together; it has a high quality look and is SUPER comfortable. I can sit in it for hours, as I have a tendency to do, and not get any lower back pain. I have to admit, I had limited options of what chairs would be delivered to me, as I am abroad and many companies would not deliver to my particular location, but HON had no issue delivering to me and in a timely fashion. I got such a great ""deal"", because the other office chairs that I was checking out were a bit more expensive than this one (I wasn't even considering it, initially), so it all worked out nicely; it looks as though it may cost 2-3 times more than it does. The reclining angle is nice and there isn't too much resistance/tension on it, so you can easily stay in a reclined position for as long as you'd like. I have set my height position, and don't have a need to adjust it, however, the maximum position is appropriate for the standard-height desk and the lever is easy to access and use. There's nothing like a good quality seat to give you comfort as you do your work. Good quality; good price and very professional look.","06 Nov 2017","","","Yes","Jata","5.0","The HON Company BSXVST305 Sadie Leather Executive Computer/Office Arms-Ergonomic Swivel Chair (HVST305), Black","/HON-Leather-Executive-Computer-Office/product-reviews/B06Y41KLTN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good for the price","Lots of prior reviews on the chair about there being no back support and that everything came packaged inside the back. They changed from that and the lumbar is very supportive. The chair is quite comfortable and the usb cable for the massage feature is surprisingly long.

"Great and comfy. Solid looking chair!","Honestly, at this price point, this chair is a great pick. It's solid and comfy and looks amazing. Works well with my setup and the assembly was awfully easy! Heres the pros to the chair -Looks are great and look premium -Easy to assemble, took about 8 minutes -Feels solid and durable unlike some other chairs at this price -Has a massager that works well Cons -The cord for the massager isn't long enough. It would be perfect if it was 6 ft -I wish there were modes for the massager (then again, this is a budget chair so there isn't much to ask for) Overall a great chair which is why I am leaving this a 5 star review!","19 Jun 2020","Color: Gray","","Yes","KhanBaba","5.0","SMUGCHAIR Racing Gaming Chair Executive Bonded Leather Computer Office Chair with Adjustable Height and Padding Armrest","/SMUGCHAIR-Executive-Leather-Computer-Adjustable/product-reviews/B089K3CFND/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Awesome chair","I’m impressed that this chair is extremely well-made with quality similar to my old DX Racer gaming chair. The pleather cushions are comfortable - even the armrests are padded for my elbows to rest upon. I can play video games all day in this chair without getting that feeling of ""sitting for too long"". It’s lightweight without being cheaply made and it reclines easily. My favorite feature is the tilt that lets you lean back as if youre sitting on a cloud. Assembly was also extremely convenient - all the parts are labeled and it comes with everything you need to put it together.

"Not as nice as it looks","For the price, this chair is not what I was expecting. The back is only connected by 2 screws on each arm rest. There is nothing connecting it to the back. It's comfortable enough but I'm concerned about how long this will last. The arms and base are plastic. It only adjusts up and down. I bought this because of the Coronavirus and having to work from home temporarily. Hopefully it holds up for a few weeks.

"Back pain in a box","I did not consider myself picky, and set very low standards for a chair in this price range and was still disappointed. Within the first day it really hurt my lower back. It’s shape forces my back to slouch and has zero lumbar support. I tried blankets, pillows, shifting and could not get comfortable. I kept trying for a week, determined to make it work and have never had a chair so deliberately hurt my back. I’m in my 20’s, no prior back problems, 5’11 and 180lbs. Only sat in the chair for maybe 4 hours at a time and it was still miserable. My wife tried it also, she’s about 5’5, 120lbs and it hurt her back also. I do not recommend this office chair.

Remember that i lost one of the screw and took a while to find it. Secondly, the shipping is somehow longer than usual (about 2 weeks).

"Good looking, comfortable for the money","I bought this as i have to work from home due to COVID, the packaging and the box is great. Very easy to assemble, took like 15 minutes but the booklet could have been better in some areas like which way to assemble especially for the hand-rest. 1. If the back side of the seat is not assembling right , that means you've put the hand-rests the wrong way. 2. Please install the wheels after you assemble the whole chair, its easier that way so the chair doesn't keep moving when you are working on it. It looks great, the color and the cushion is awesome including the padding. There is tilt but it's not the way you expect, the back side of the seat doesn't move rather it tilts from the bottom. I know its nice feature to have the back tilt, but i'm okay for the price. Don't know how long it lasts but for $115, this is more than good. The only worry i have is the back is literally held by 4 screws, 2 on each side and doesn't have any other support.","20 Apr 2020","","","Yes","Sri7","5.0","AmazonBasics High-Back Bonded Leather Executive Office Computer Desk Chair - Brown","/AmazonBasics-High-Back-Leather-Executive-Computer/product-reviews/B082KYYMZ6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"My buttocks are happy.","Original Post: I got this chair to replace an old office chair that decided to shed its fake pleather skin... everywhere. You wouldn’t believe the places I’ve found that stuff. Also after several years my butt made quite the “impression “ on it and well... goodbye chair padding. I’m a bigger gal I’ll admit, so I couldn’t raise the chair height anymore... trying just turned it into a weird amusement park ride where you’re confused if you had a good time or not and if the equipment was safe. But now, the moment you’ve been waiting for. I had some doubts about the mesh back, as that was a fashion statement in the late 80’s and I wasn’t sure the chair could “rock” it. Turns out it’s pretty great when the air conditioning fails and you’ve got a fan behind you. I’ve had this thing for a weekend... still like it... that’s longer than my last boyfriend stayed in my good graces. Anyhoo, it was easy to put together but slightly awkward... would have been much faster and easier if The Rock was included for assembly but beggars can’t be choosers. The cushion is nice. My butt seems to enjoy it much better than the last chair. It felt like it was cheating on good ole rusty the office chair but it forgot about that peeling delinquent rapidly. I do wish the back of the chair could lean back though... my ceiling feels neglected if I don’t give it a hard stare every so often. The whole chair will tilt but not just the back. I like how you can adjust the lumbar support as well, great feature on 80’s mesh stylist chair. The arms though. Dear lawd. Why no padding? My elbows hurt something fierce sometimes... and sometimes my arms go numb which makes video gameing awkward.... I mean, imagine it. Intense battle, everyone is fighting for their lives and the hot elf is just standing there being useless because her arms went numb. I’ll be getting some armchair pads to help with this so my teammates have a functioning elf that doesn’t have noodle arms. Other than that, good chair! Also the arms are adjustable, very... handy. I’d take a photo but that requires getting dressed in case there’s a sneaky reflection somewhere and I’m honestly too lazy and dressed for bed already. The existing photos in other reviews are spot on though. Also the seat is nice and wide for my big bottom, larger than the average office chair. No pinching in weird places. EDIT! September 8th, 2019 I return! Having put some mileage into this chair I thought I'd update ya! It does make small noises now, nothing to get excited over really as I hardly notice it. My butt has formed an imprint upon the cushion which is very noticeable. I will likely have to buy a cushion as the chair ages. Overall it seems to have held up well. I did purchase Arm rest covers for the arms as they were quite hard! They greatly helped and only cost about $10.

"At 450lbs, this chair is a must","I haven't had the chair very long, however I have been through a handful of chairs in the last year.  All rated to hold 400+ lbs.  Over the years of office work, I have also sat in a wide array of different, much more expensive chairs.  And right now, this chair is one of the best I have been in.  The pad is super thick, wide, and deep.  The support board under it is just as wide and deep, so I do not feel I am overflowing the support structure of the chair. Right now, this is one of the better chairs.  The construction felt solid and I had no damage to mine when I got it. I think the only immediate improvement would be the back rest.  It should have some horizontal adjustment for people who want to sit further back in the seat.","02 Mar 2019","","","Yes","Seikojin","4.0","Big and Tall Office Chair 400lbs Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair with Lumbar Support Wide Seat Adjust Arms Rolling Swivel High Back Task Executive Ergonomic Chair for Women Men,Black","/BestOffice-Tall-400lb-Office-Chair/product-reviews/B07KDS893Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Buyer Beware - 30 day warranty ONLY","I have had this chair for 6 months and liked it ok. It's wide and roomy, and the back support is nice. I must admit my hips ache when I sit in it for about an hour without standing; there's a ridge in the seat that sits right along your ""crack"" and I think that's the main source of discomfort. I was hoping I would adjust to it, but no. Anyway, 5 months into owning the chair one of the armrests won't stay at level - the merest pressure and it drops. Weirdly, I never adjust the armrests ever - just set them when I first got the chair, so it's not like I've been killing the latch position. In contacting the seller for manufacturer's information, I was informed the seller IS the manufacturer of record and there are no additional warranties beyond the initial 30-day return window. Additionally, there are no replacement parts available. At $150 I wish I would have examined the fine print before purchasing.

"Chair that is truly made for big people","I took some pictures of my old chair that I spent 90 bucks or so on vs this chair, both set to max height for sake of comparison. It's like my old chair was a child's toy. This chair is a monster! The chair is WIDE and THICC, they aren't playing around. For the first time in years I can rest my arms on the armrest of a chair, and sit in one without my ass spilling out the sides. I'm sure every big person knows that feeling. Installation was simple enough, took me about 30-40 minutes alone and I had to wrestle with it in the end but very simple overall. The chair says it supports 400 pounds and I believe them. It's solid and sturdy, but cushioned. I weigh close to 300 and am 6'1 as of this review and I can sit in this without feeling like this thing may break in half. The images don't do this thing justice, it's a big chair. I also want to address the issues people seem to have with reclining. It doesn't lay horizontally, no. But it DOES recline quite a bit, you have to pull out the lever that's used to raise and lower the seat and it'll allow you to lay back. It feels a little scary but the chair will catch you. It's probably a 30-40 degree angle. The armrests are lightly padded and they do give just a little side to side, this is most likely to accommodate different arm resting positions, which is really nice. You can move them up or down and they go up very high. Lumbar support is also padded and is very sturdy. It's not some cheap piece of plastic going across the chair. So that's about it really. I wanted to wait to do this review until a week, but my first impressions were so positive I had to post this now. If you're a big guy and you need a chair you can fit in, please give this one a try before you buy some 500 dollar ""big and tall"" chair. I think you'll be glad you did!","09 Jul 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R4BUQmhFL._SY88.jpg

My butt seems to enjoy it much better than the last chair. It felt like it was cheating on good ole rusty the office chair but it forgot about that peeling delinquent rapidly. I do wish the back of the chair could lean back though... my ceiling feels neglected if I don’t give it a hard stare every so often. The whole chair will tilt but not just the back. I like how you can adjust the lumbar support as well, great feature on 80’s mesh stylist chair. The arms though. Dear lawd. Why no padding? My elbows hurt something fierce sometimes... and sometimes my arms go numb which makes video gameing awkward.... I mean, imagine it. Intense battle, everyone is fighting for their lives and the hot elf is just standing there being useless because her arms went numb. I’ll be getting some armchair pads to help with this so my teammates have a functioning elf that doesn’t have noodle arms. Other than that, good chair! Also the arms are adjustable, very... handy. I’d take a photo but that requires getting dressed in case there’s a sneaky reflection somewhere and I’m honestly too lazy and dressed for bed already. The existing photos in other reviews are spot on though. Also the seat is nice and wide for my big bottom, larger than the average office chair. No pinching in weird places. EDIT! September 8th, 2019 I return! Having put some mileage into this chair I thought I'd update ya! It does make small noises now, nothing to get excited over really as I hardly notice it. My butt has formed an imprint upon the cushion which is very noticeable. I will likely have to buy a cushion as the chair ages. Overall it seems to have held up well. I did purchase Arm rest covers for the arms as they were quite hard! They greatly helped and only cost about $10. Overall, I'm still happy with this chair!","09 Apr 2019","","","Yes","JollyNova","5.0","Big and Tall Office Chair 400lbs Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair with Lumbar Support Wide Seat Adjust Arms Rolling Swivel High Back Task Executive Ergonomic Chair for Women Men,Black","/BestOffice-Tall-400lb-Office-Chair/product-reviews/B07KDS893Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"At 450lbs, this chair is a must","I haven't had the chair very long, however I have been through a handful of chairs in the last year.  All rated to hold 400+ lbs.  Over the years of office work, I have also sat in a wide array of different, much more expensive chairs.  And right now, this chair is one of the best I have been in.  The pad is super thick, wide, and deep.  The support board under it is just as wide and deep, so I do not feel I am overflowing the support structure of the chair. Right now, this is one of the better chairs.  The construction felt solid and I had no damage to mine when I got it. I think the only immediate improvement would be the back rest.  It should have some horizontal adjustment for people who want to sit further back in the seat.","02 Mar 2019","","","Yes","Seikojin","4.0","Big and Tall Office Chair 400lbs Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair with Lumbar Support Wide Seat Adjust Arms Rolling Swivel High Back Task Executive Ergonomic Chair for Women Men,Black","/BestOffice-Tall-400lb-Office-Chair/product-reviews/B07KDS893Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"terrible","I have had it for 7 months. Stopped being useful and became an actual health problem 5 months in. There are springs in the anus area of the chair. once the foam loses it's support (after about 2 months of ownership) the springs begin to compress your anus and hip area. Found myself with severe hip pain that only happens while sitting in this chair. This chair has cost me so much more beyond the price tag.","14 Mar 2019","","","Yes","Ms. Lawrence","1.0","Big and Tall Office Chair 400lbs Desk Chair Mesh Computer Chair with Lumbar Support Wide Seat Adjust Arms Rolling Swivel High Back Task Executive Ergonomic Chair for Women Men,Black","/BestOffice-Tall-400lb-Office-Chair/product-reviews/B07KDS893Z/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Buyer Beware - 30 day warranty ONLY","I have had this chair for 6 months and liked it ok. It's wide and roomy, and the back support is nice. I must admit my hips ache when I sit in it for about an hour without standing; there's a ridge in the seat that sits right along your ""crack"" and I think that's the main source of discomfort. I was hoping I would adjust to it, but no. Anyway, 5 months into owning the chair one of the armrests won't stay at level - the merest pressure and it drops. Weirdly, I never adjust the armrests ever - just set them when I first got the chair, so it's not like I've been killing the latch position. In contacting the seller for manufacturer's information, I was informed the seller IS the manufacturer of record and there are no additional warranties beyond the initial 30-day return window. Additionally, there are no replacement parts available. At $150 I wish I would have examined the fine print before purchasing.

"Comfortable and sturdy, but maybe not as durable?","So I bought this chair in the beginning of 2019. Great value for a solid chair for heavier individuals. Very comfortable, love the shuttle am rests and the solid base. Unfortunately  after 9 months, one of the holes for the wheel casters broke off. Now for reference I'm only 330lbs so will under the 400 lb weight limit, and just put the chair to regular use. Not sure if this was just a defect with the welds on the base off my chair but it's a bummer for that to happen.

"Chair that is truly made for big people","I took some pictures of my old chair that I spent 90 bucks or so on vs this chair, both set to max height for sake of comparison. It's like my old chair was a child's toy. This chair is a monster! The chair is WIDE and THICC, they aren't playing around. For the first time in years I can rest my arms on the armrest of a chair, and sit in one without my ass spilling out the sides. I'm sure every big person knows that feeling. Installation was simple enough, took me about 30-40 minutes alone and I had to wrestle with it in the end but very simple overall. The chair says it supports 400 pounds and I believe them. It's solid and sturdy, but cushioned. I weigh close to 300 and am 6'1 as of this review and I can sit in this without feeling like this thing may break in half. The images don't do this thing justice, it's a big chair. I also want to address the issues people seem to have with reclining. It doesn't lay horizontally, no. But it DOES recline quite a bit, you have to pull out the lever that's used to raise and lower the seat and it'll allow you to lay back. It feels a little scary but the chair will catch you. It's probably a 30-40 degree angle. The armrests are lightly padded and they do give just a little side to side, this is most likely to accommodate different arm resting positions, which is really nice. You can move them up or down and they go up very high. Lumbar support is also padded and is very sturdy. It's not some cheap piece of plastic going across the chair. So that's about it really. I wanted to wait to do this review until a week, but my first impressions were so positive I had to post this now. If you're a big guy and you need a chair you can fit in, please give this one a try before you buy some 500 dollar ""big and tall"" chair. I think you'll be glad you did!","09 Jul 2020","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R4BUQmhFL._SY88.jpg

"Seat not comfortable - foam goes out within a few days","I'm actually pretty disappointed with this purchase.  I had spent the extra money over a cheaper chair because I believed this one would have adequate padding in the seat cushion on top of all the cool levers.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Within a week of using it, the foam seat already depresses after a minute of sitting down (and I'm 115 pounds, and not all of it is on the chair).  It re-inflates after a period of not sitting on it, but it compresses down quickly once you return to sit on it.  Personally, I have issues that require extra padding when I sit, so this is an important issue for me.  The chair would have been much, much better quality had the seat cushion been better and more durable. Other than that, it's an okay chair.  Easy to assemble, good back support, adjustable height and back tilt (I wish you could tilt the chair back farther).  Packaging was messy on the inside, but nothing was scratched. There are cheaper chairs here on Amazon for forty or sixty bucks that are just as comfortable as this chair, but I guess if you want the ability to tilt the seat and back, this chair could be for you.

There is NO lumbar support unless you consider some curved mesh sufficient - and I don't. I sit in the char for hours sometimes while gaming and true lumbar support would be welcome.

"I almost flattened it!","I really like this chair! After the delivery oops and me almost running over the box in the dark, I got the chair in the house piece by piece, from the damaged box. The delivery guy had put it in my carport 50 feet away from my house. All of the parts were there and nothing damaged but the box. The directions were clear (if I paid attention and didn't get ahead of myself) and I am sitting on it now typing this review. I'm 71 and 5'1"" and was able to assemble it by myself.

"So far so good","Literally just got it and sat on it since. Unlike my 10 year old office chair, I do feel much better sitting on it for a long amount of time, like 8 hours. I'm not sure about lumbar support since I never had issue on my lumbar area before, so I can't comment on that much. Mesh back lets my back breathe too. I kinda sweat a lot and my old chair gets wet if it gets too hot. However, with this chair I rather feel breeze on my back  and felt cool for my long sit time. Assembly was pretty easy too. Though I kinda have bad feeling about one of the base stick came separate and I had to install it.

"New purchase","I just purchased this product so I can’t give much of an opinion on comfort. But just by sitting in it after putting it together it seems comfortable and well made. I purchased this bc of the ability to move the arms. That was a huge selling point for me. Great for the price. I will say this, instructions say to screw the arms on tight before adding the back. Don’t do that, it makes things so difficult. Keep the arms loose and then tighten after the back is attached. I had to unscrew the arms so I could get the back on. Just a tip!

I would recommend that when you use the assembly instruction sheet that you assemble  in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, and 6.  I found it easier to put the armrests on first and then align the armrest with the seat.  Also, when you install the mechanism, be sure that it is on the right side when you are sitting down.  If it is on the left side, the seat will tilt you forward and not a backward as it should - learned that the hard way.  Once assembled correctly,  it is quite comfortable, tilts back nicely, and the ability to raise the arms  is a nice feature.  The price is reasonable.

"Bought this for my dad's birthday and he loves it!","We used to have a chair that did not look at all modern and at the same time didn't allow for good posture. I've searched on Ikea for a good chair that has a good price and couldn't find any for under $100. Then I decided to go on Amazon, this chair stood out from the rest because it was slick and fits right into our modern home. I decided to buy it as a gift for my dad's birthday since I couldn't think of anything else to get him. Upon receiving the shipping box, it was packaged very nicely and once out of the box the chair was super easy to assemble since I just had to follow the instructions that were clear and concise. It only took my 10 minutes to assemble and I surprised him once he had got home. He fell in love with it since the comfort was just right. The lumbar spine was well rested against that back of the chair and even though the back support was fixed in that angle, it wasn't necessary to have the adjustable back since this was just right to have a good posture. The seat is indeed comfortable and has a very nice cushion, the chair is light weight and the wheels are smooth on my wood laminated floors. I'm quite happy that my dad loves it and I think the price is quite amazing.","27 Aug 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71upPdgXSxL._SY88.jpg

"Got what I wanted","I wanted a desk chair that molded to me, not one that molded me. With this chair, I got what I wanted. Also, the padding under my bottom on my last two desk chairs wore out in about 2 years. I don't have much padding on my bottom so I need my chair to have some. I couldn't find a separate pad I to sit on that could keep the rest of the chairs' molding in alignment. Judging from the picture, it looked like this chair didn't scrimp on padding for the bottom.  Again, I got what I wanted. This chair's deck has substantial padding for the bottom--and for the back. As far as assembly goes, for most people, it will take two people to put the chair back on--one person to line the screw holes up and another to put the screws in. And it was much easier to seat the screws after I pulled the fabric back to completely expose the screw holes. As for the delivery, the chair arrived on time--a 2-day delivery and our hard-working, good-looking Amazon delivery man carried the chair up three flights of stairs to our place and was happy to do it. Recalling this man's example of excellent customer service makes sitting in this chair all the better.","22 May 2019","Color: 3288gy","","Yes","Lin Sloan","5.0","SP Velvet Office Chair Adjustable Tilt Angle and Flip-up Arms Executive Computer Desk Chair, Thick Padding for Comfort and Ergonomic Design for Lumbar Support (Beige)","/Adjustable-Flip-up-Executive-Computer-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07TJG59ND/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great Chair and Greatest customer service","First, this chair is SUPER comfortable and stylish to boot.  The fabric is soft, and the cushions are well designed and supportive.  I have no doubt this chair will last a very long time. I had a very minor issue with the chair, a couple of stitches that were overlapped at a certain point, and only because I'm a total perfectionist, did I write the seller, more to just let them know than to ask for any replacement or compensation. Myka's, the seller, could not have been more lovely and timely in their responses to me.  I assured them I was not unhappy, only wanted to alert them to a minor manufacturing error, likely one that is not recurring, and that I wasn't seeking any reparations. Regardless, they jumped into action and gave me numerous options to ensure that I was 100% satisfied with the purchase.  The company is located in China, and were even sensitive concerning time zones (e.g. When they wrote, ""we will respond to you tomorrow as it is midnight here in China..."" and by the time I awoke the next day, there was a response in my inbox). If you're on the fence about purchasing this chair, I encourage you to go for it.  Both the chair and the company are top-notch.  As I sit in the chair now, writing this, I can assure you that the ""comfort"" stretched way beyond the superb quality of the chair, and to my entire shopping experience.","30 Sep 2019","Color: 3288gy","","Yes","nyc buyer","5.0","SP Velvet Office Chair Adjustable Tilt Angle and Flip-up Arms Executive Computer Desk Chair, Thick Padding for Comfort and Ergonomic Design for Lumbar Support (Beige)","/Adjustable-Flip-up-Executive-Computer-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07TJG59ND/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good, but does NOT recline.","This review is for the 3288RW SP Velvet Office Chair . UPDATE │ Warranty is top-notch. Comparable to Aeron or Steelcase, CONSIDERING the cost of the chair. Best customer service I've dealt with for a long time. No regrets. NEW VERDICT: ★★★★★ | 5 stars out of 5, They updated the product page, and new buyers should not have the same complaint I had. You can ignore my ""recline""-related complaints below (the rest of the review still applies). - - - TL;DR │ It's a beautiful and comfortable chair, but...falsely advertised at the time I bought it. This chair DOES NOT recline. Also, the color is a bit off from their photos, more on that later. I got this chair specifically because of ""the backrest tilts independently to respond to natural body movements"" (a.k.a. recline). Well, it does not. I kind of figured it out when I was assembling it. The back and the seat is connected via the armrest, which DOES NOT bend. This means your whole upper body weight is supported by two screws on each side.

WHAT I DON'T LIKE │ × │ × Does not recline. × It might die quick (material, color, and frame). × Armrest not adjustable. × Has scratches on the chrome armrest. × Price was for a reclining chair. × Difficult to assemble alone.

WRONG. I usually stand in front of my sit-stand desk, but when I sit, it has to be 135 degrees. This chair DOES NOT have that capability. For the price, I expected this very basic functionality. The whole chair tilts, like a rocking chair. Also, the color is off. The photos show sand color, but I got more like light wheat. Even though I liked what I got better, other people should note about it. I have no idea what ""RW"" means in the color code. - - - VERDICT: I *can* recommend this product if you still like it after my warning. ★★★★☆ | 4 stars out of 5.

"Got what I wanted","I wanted a desk chair that molded to me, not one that molded me. With this chair, I got what I wanted. Also, the padding under my bottom on my last two desk chairs wore out in about 2 years. I don't have much padding on my bottom so I need my chair to have some. I couldn't find a separate pad I to sit on that could keep the rest of the chairs' molding in alignment. Judging from the picture, it looked like this chair didn't scrimp on padding for the bottom.  Again, I got what I wanted. This chair's deck has substantial padding for the bottom--and for the back. As far as assembly goes, for most people, it will take two people to put the chair back on--one person to line the screw holes up and another to put the screws in. And it was much easier to seat the screws after I pulled the fabric back to completely expose the screw holes. As for the delivery, the chair arrived on time--a 2-day delivery and our hard-working, good-looking Amazon delivery man carried the chair up three flights of stairs to our place and was happy to do it. Recalling this man's example of excellent customer service makes sitting in this chair all the better.","22 May 2019","Color: 3288gy","","Yes","Lin Sloan","5.0","SP Velvet Office Chair Adjustable Tilt Angle and Flip-up Arms Executive Computer Desk Chair, Thick Padding for Comfort and Ergonomic Design for Lumbar Support (Beige)","/Adjustable-Flip-up-Executive-Computer-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07TJG59ND/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Wonderful chair","This chair is big and comfortable. I am so pleased I got it.  I really don't like chairs with curved seats and this chair has a large, flat seat that is firm but super comfortable.  I like to sit on my foot or cross legged - so it is perfect for that.  I am 5'4, and on the lowest setting my feet are flat on the floor.  The tilt is very nice and the arms fold-up when you need them out of the way.

"Great Chair and Greatest customer service","First, this chair is SUPER comfortable and stylish to boot.  The fabric is soft, and the cushions are well designed and supportive.  I have no doubt this chair will last a very long time. I had a very minor issue with the chair, a couple of stitches that were overlapped at a certain point, and only because I'm a total perfectionist, did I write the seller, more to just let them know than to ask for any replacement or compensation. Myka's, the seller, could not have been more lovely and timely in their responses to me.  I assured them I was not unhappy, only wanted to alert them to a minor manufacturing error, likely one that is not recurring, and that I wasn't seeking any reparations. Regardless, they jumped into action and gave me numerous options to ensure that I was 100% satisfied with the purchase.  The company is located in China, and were even sensitive concerning time zones (e.g. When they wrote, ""we will respond to you tomorrow as it is midnight here in China..."" and by the time I awoke the next day, there was a response in my inbox). If you're on the fence about purchasing this chair, I encourage you to go for it.  Both the chair and the company are top-notch.  As I sit in the chair now, writing this, I can assure you that the ""comfort"" stretched way beyond the superb quality of the chair, and to my entire shopping experience.","30 Sep 2019","Color: 3288gy","","Yes","nyc buyer","5.0","SP Velvet Office Chair Adjustable Tilt Angle and Flip-up Arms Executive Computer Desk Chair, Thick Padding for Comfort and Ergonomic Design for Lumbar Support (Beige)","/Adjustable-Flip-up-Executive-Computer-Ergonomic/product-reviews/B07TJG59ND/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Comfortable chair","It's rare for me to write a review for a product that I'm actually happy with.  This chair will be an exception.  I placed the order on May 21, 2020.  The expected delivery date was actually June 9, 2020.  I received it on May 23, 2020 much to my surprise.  The reason I ordered this chair was because my previous chair was long over due for replacement.  There was no cushion left on the seat or the back of the chair.  It was a cheap chair I ordered back in 2017.  After 3 years of use, it was pretty much destroyed.  So, I was pushed to order a new chair by a severe back injury that the previous chair was making worse.  I couldn't sit comfortably.  I could barely walk.  I had to use nearby furniture to stand up.  Well, I've had this chair for 4 weeks today.  I have no back pain that isn't work related.  The pain in my wrist is gone.  I'm not saying the chair performed miracles.  It just lacks deficiencies that my last chair had. So, I'm 5'8, 250lbs.  The chair is extremely comfortable.  It's very supportive.  The cushion height is perfect for me.  The arm rests are at the correct level for my desk.  The chair back is contoured in the correct way.  There is no strain on my body from this chair. The seat and back have some heft to them.  That's one of the downsides to buying a chair that can support people above 250lbs.  Adding strength adds weight.  The stitching patterns don't line up properly.  But can you see them while you're sitting it in?  Stitch alignment has no affect on comfort. Based on my experience over the last 4 weeks, I would have no problem buying this chair again.","20 Jun 2020","Color: Coal Black","","Yes","A.

"Exceeded my expectations w/ nice extra touch to it","I checked other reviews before buying it and after good amount of research I thought this chair was the winner: best features within the right price. Delivery happened before I was expecting it to show up. Well packed, all parts included, even had spare screws in the assembly kit. Assembly was a breeze, simple and quick. And one thing that caught my attention was a little pocket on the back of the chair, but I left that to check after assembling and testing the chair. Test drive was perfect, adjustments easy to make while seated and then I checked the back pocket and noticed it had a USB-A cable (?!?). First thought was that being a hybrid of office/gaming chair this USB would be for sound functions may be??? Well, I connected it to my laptop to check what would happen and....Surprise!!!! Vibrating back massage....WOW! I wasn't expecting this which blew my mind! For whatever reason this is not advertised or commented by anyone: the fact the chair has a back massage feature. It's simple vibrating tool which actually does a decent job after some time seating. Anyways, I was happy with the purchase but the extra touch puts this at a vibrating 5 stars!

"Decent for the price","I had to buy a chair for working at home (as well as other things like a laptop lift, extra keyboard and mouse) to survive during the lock down.  I like this chair because it is quite comfortable, and I love that you can raise the arms to get them out of the way if you need to, for tucking it under the table or making it more streamlined.  As far as lower back support goes, it's not the best, but I added a lumbar cushion for that.  It's quite good for the price, in my opinion, and it's comfortable.  I also wanted a chair that wasn't huge, as I don't have a lot of room, so this one is great.","27 Jun 2020","Color: Coal Black","","Yes","OC Girl","5.0","Office Computer Desk Chair Wheels, Caster Wheels for Mesh Task Swiveling Chairs","/Leather-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Executive-Computer/product-reviews/B0836X99BR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Loved at first - Disappointed Now","I have actually purchased 4 of these chairs just because of the comfort level of them. However, I am now noticing the first two (Black ones) I purchased is starting to bubble up and peel. Be very wary of everyday use, because apparently, the cover wears out quickly. I have never been so disappointed in a product or a company. Especially when they DO NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT! A chair should not be peeling like this at barely 4 months old. 1 was purchased November 14, 2019 and the other November 20, 2019. The first picture was when it started bubbling on February 18th, the 2nd picture is that bubble today. I have had to put tape on it to keep it from getting worse.

"Love it so far.","I'm not big into computer chairs so I cant say how this compares to other chairs of similar value but I personally really like it. Very comfortable, easy to put together and has a great lumbar support. I am using it for work where I am behind a desk for 8+ hours a day. Will update in the future to say how it holds up. The only thing I wish was different is I wish it was lower. It fits under my desk fine and the arm rests are great, I just like lower sitting chairs.

"Absolutely Love This Chair!","I have been looking at chairs for years and even bought one last week and returned it.  I was hesitant to buy a chair I never sat in, but decided to take a chance and am glad I did.  I am extremely happy with this chair.  It is firm, sturdy and high quality materials and workmanship.  Assembly was easy and everything you need is supplied.  One recommendation though would be to attach the lumbar bracket that comes out of the chair back to the base bracket before attaching the bracket to the bottom of the chair.  The lumbar bracket is under tension and I had to get help to pull it down to put the screw in.  I love the active lumbar support and the tilt up arms.  Now I can push the chair all the way under the desk.","07 Nov 2019","Color: Brown","","Yes","K Shilling","5.0","AmazonCommercial Ergonomic High-Back Bonded Leather Executive Chair with Flip-Up Arms and Lumbar Support, Cream","/AmazonCommercial-Ergonomic-High-Back-Leather-Executive/product-reviews/B07S57CCXF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
